<h1 id="常考题">常考题</h1>
<h2 id="work-or-study">Work or Study</h2>
<ol>
<li>Why did you choose that subject?<br>
I am majoring in International Business. I chose my major subject of study based on my aptitude in studying economics, accounting, and languages, my interest in travel, and advice from my parents and teachers. I felt this major area of study would prepare me for a career that I would find interesting and that I could be successful in.</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose business as a subject because it gives me <strong><tagname style="color:red">an excellent foundation</tagname></strong> to enter my <strong><tagname style="color:red">desired career</tagname></strong> upon completion of my studies. It is important for me to <strong><tagname style="color:red">take the same career path as my father</tagname></strong>, as he has had an incredibly successful one, and I would like to <strong><tagname style="color:red">emulate</tagname></strong> that.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Is it interesting?<br>
I truly enjoy my courses because they are so interesting. There are a few courses that are more difficult for me than others, but I find if I put more time and effort into studying, I am able do well in them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, it brings lots of fun. I get quite some time to <strong><tagname style="color:red">personally interact</tagname></strong> with my teachers, enabling me to <strong><tagname style="color:red">go into great depth</tagname></strong> while studying material that I find particularly interesting. In addition, by sharing impressive knowledge on the subject in my online blog, I have attracted thousands of fans. I really love.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What subjects are you studying?<br>
This year, I’m taking advanced classes in Finance, Macroeconomics, English, and Information Technology. I am also taking a class in Modern European History because I thought this would be interesting.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am currently studying both business marketing and psychology as a joint degree. These two courses give me both a <strong><tagname style="color:red">theoretical</tagname></strong> business knowledge on marketing campaigns and <strong><tagname style="color:red">practical</tagname></strong> working skills. It also provides me with a psychological background that allows me to understand the reasons behind various aspects of those topics better.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoon?<br>
I prefer to study in the afternoon. I feel more alert in the afternoon than I do in the morning or the evening. I seem to be able to read, and comprehend more, in less time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compared with many friends who like to study in the afternoons, I prefer to study in the mornings With a g-hour sleep at night, I am very energetic in the mornings, and I can better focus on solving severe problems.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Are you looking forward to working?<br>
I am definitely looking forward to using the things I have learned in school in my career. I’m also looking forward to making money to support myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I am. Even though working can be stressful and challenging, I do enjoy it. However, finishing my studies and starting my career is exciting, as I will have the opportunity to apply what I learned. Besides, with a salary, I can be financially independent, and buy anything I like without worry about my parents rejections.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Do you like your subject?<br>
I love my subject because it is so interesting. I find the more I learn, the more I find interesting about it! I think everything I am learning will be useful in my career.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do, because it directly relates to my desired career path. The subject offers a perspective on the marketing business and interesting knowledge about human psychology. The combination of these two aspects is going to help me open an advertisement business.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>What work do you do?<br>
I recently started as a research assistant at a large international advertising firm. It’s an entry level position where I find statistics about the likes and dislikes of different age groups in a specific country that our client is looking to do business in.</li>
</ol>
<p>I currently work as a marketing assistant at a large company that sells electronic products. In particular, I design advertising posters for the global launch of new products in the Chinese market.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Why did you choose to do that type of work?<br>
While this is not the final job that I was hoping for, it is a solid entry-level position in a firm that does the kind of work I am interested in. I enjoy gathering the statistics knowing that they will be used to make important decisions in marketing our client’s product. I feel there is a lot of room for promotion here in this company as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose this work to <strong><tagname style="color:red">follow my fathers footsteps</tagname></strong>. My father has been working in marketing for his entire life, Since I was very young, my father shared several <strong><tagname style="color:red">insights</tagname></strong> about his work in the form of curious stories. These stories always <strong><tagname style="color:red">caught my interest</tagname></strong>, which later transformed into my passion.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Do you miss being a student?<br>
I didn’t think that I would, but I do.As much as I like my job and I am grateful to have it, it is a big change. I am meeting new people and learning new responsibilities; my daily schedule is very different, but I need to expect a period of adjustment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes and no. I miss the time spent studying with my friends and working towards a standard qualification. However, since finishing my studies, I do prefer the freedom of being able to <strong><tagname style="color:red">move on and start my career</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Do you like your job?<br>
I really enjoy my job. I think the work is interesting and look forward to learning more. I like all of the people I work with. There are two other research assistants who were hired the same time I was and I enjoy working with them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I do. My job allows me to <strong><tagname style="color:red">interact with a variety of people from different backgrounds and cultures</tagname></strong> every day. I find the work itself to be extremely <strong><tagname style="color:red">fulfilling</tagname></strong>, and I really appreciate the way my efforts get rewarded.</p>
<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Can you describe the place where you live?<br>
I live in a high rise apartment building on the 5th floor overlooking the street with apartment buildings on either side. We have a balcony where we keep many of our plants and sometimes we’ll sit there in the evening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you live there?<br>
I have lived there for 18 years. I was born there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you live with?<br>
I live with my parents, my sister, and my dog. Sometimes my grandparents or aunt will visit us and they stay with us in our home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you plan to live there for a long time?<br>
I’m hoping after I finish my education, I find a job and I can find my own home. Housing is expensive, so I may be home with my parents longer than I plan to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between where you are living now and where you have lived in the past?<br>
I haven’t lived anywhere else. I have always lived here. My parents lived in a smaller apartment in a building nearby before I was born, but they moved here because they needed more room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?<br>
I prefer living in a flat because it is so much more convenient, and neighbours seem much more friendly. Perhaps I like it because this is what I am accustomed to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the future, what type of place would you like to live in?<br>
I would like to live in a flat on the very top floor of a building. I think it would be quieter and we wouldn’t be able hear as much street noise and the view, especially at night, would be spectacular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of neighbourhood /environment/surroundings/home would you like to live in?<br>
I like living in the city where I am. I like the convenience of being very close to public transportation so I can go where ever I need to go. I like my neighbourhood because we have a variety of young people and old people. It’s our own community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?<br>
We eat, sleep, and basically live together there. When we are all at home, we sometimes do things together, like watching sports on TV, other times we will go to our room to study or listen to music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which room does your family spend most of the time in?<br>
We spend most of our time in the living room. We will watch TV there or play games while lying on the floor. It’s the sunniest room in the house, so it is very pleasant to be in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What part of your home do you like the most?<br>
I like my bedroom the most in my home. I have it decorated to my taste and feel safe and calm whenever I go into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the transport facilities to your home very good?<br>
Absolutely, that’s one of the reasons I like our neighbourhood. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the bus stop and from there, I can get anywhere in the city.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hometown">Hometown</h2>
<p>1.What’s (the name of) your hometown?<br>
I live in Guangzhou. It is located in the Guangdong Province. and is known as the City of Flowers.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Is that a big city or a small place?<br>
It is the third largest city in China. It has a population of over 13 million people. It’s a big place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please describe your hometown a little.<br>
It is the educational and cultural centre of Southern China. It’s also known as the City of Flowers because there are evergreens and flowers in bloom year round because of its climate. It’s a pretty city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you lived there?<br>
I have lived here all of my life, for eighteen years. My parents have lived here all of their lives too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like it?<br>
I like it very much. Of course, this is all I have ever known, but whenever my family travels anywhere, I am always happiest when I return home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like living there?<br>
I like living here because my family is here, my grandparents and aunt live here too. I like the climate because it never gets really cold. I don’t really like all of the rain we get in the summer, but even then, the rain keeps the air cleaner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you like (the most) about your hometown?<br>
I really like the food. The Cantonese food is excellent and there are so many other kinds of international restaurants to try. I also really enjoy Thai food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there anything you dislike about it?<br>
The humidity gets things damp in the house, so we have to use air conditioning a lot of the time. I don’t really like air conditioning, but we don’t have a choice but to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think you will continue living there for a long time? / 10. Do you plan to continue living there? ( Combined two similar questions as one)<br>
I want to go abroad to study after I graduate from high school. I want to see what other cities and countries have to offer and then I’ll decide.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-area-you-live-in">The area you live in</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like the area that you live in?<br>
I love the area that I live in. I am so lucky that we have so much to do which are very close to us! Also, there is public transportation just one block from my building. Everything is so convenient!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some changes in the area recently?<br>
Over the past few years, some new restaurants have opened nearby which make eating out more convenient for everyone in the area. Also, last year, improvements were made to the park near my house. Some older trees were trimmed and some new varieties of trees were planted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you know any famous people in your area?<br>
Well, I really don’t think any famous people live near me. I have never heard of or met any famous person in my neighbourhood. I guess it’s because the area I am living in is an area for middle income families, not for famous people who have much higher salaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do you like to go in that area?<br>
Like I said earlier, there are some new restaurants in the area. They are family-style restaurants, so they are the great places to go with my family for relaxed meals. Also, the park has always been a pleasant place to go. Everything I need or want is within walking distance to my home.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="老题">老题</h1>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<ol>
<li>When do you listen to music?<br>
I listen to music whenever I can. I enjoy listening to music when I'm <strong><tagname style="color:red">on public transportation</tagname></strong>, going to and from school. I also like to listen to music sometimes when I'm studying. It helps to<br>
<strong><tagname style="color:red">block out</tagname></strong> things in the background so I'm able to focus better.</li>
</ol>
<p>I listen to music whenever I have an opportunity to do so. This is mainly when I am walking to work in the morning. I love music a lot, as it makes me relaxed and happy.</p>
<p>2.. How much time do you spend listening to music every day?<br>
I haven't really thought about that. I think I spend about 2 to 3 hours a day. I listen to it on public transportation and then when I study, but not all the time when I study. Sometimes it's distracting when I'm studying, but I would say 2 to 3 hours a day is a fair estimate.</p>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">Putting an exact timescale on it is hard</tagname></strong>. On an average day I would estimate that I listen to music for at least 3 or 4 hours On weekends, I spend even more time, as I like to have relaxing background music throughout the day.</p>
<p>3.. What kinds of music do you like to listen to?<br>
I really enjoy K-pop, the energy and the lyrics, it’s just so lively and makes me feel good. I also like to listen to slower songs that have a deeper story like a ballad or something- a lot of fun to listen to a ballad. I also like to listen to instrumental music where there are no words, I sometimes find that to be very soothing when I'm trying to study.</p>
<p>I have a very <strong><tagname style="color:red">eclectic</tagname></strong> music taste. Depending on what mood I am in, I can listen to anything from blues and reggae, to rock and metal music. Lately, I have been listening to Pink Floyds quite a lot.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What’s your favourite kind of music?<br>
Without question my favourite music is K-pop. You can't listen to it without enjoying it. It's lively and it makes you feel good and when you're listening to it you're tapping your foot and just getting ready to be excited for the rest of your day. It just always puts me in a good mood.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favourite kind of music is rock-and-roll. <strong><tagname style="color:red">In particular</tagname></strong>, I like the music by Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath, but I also love newer bands like Avenged Sevenfold.  <strong><tagname style="color:red">Despite</tagname></strong> my love for this kind of music, sometimes, I listen to the top pop songs of the moment.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Have you ever been to a concert before?<br>
Sadly, I have not been to a concert, but I'd like to go to one soon. Concerts are expensive but I'm saving up money and I have a few concerts that I have that in mind that I'd like to go to.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been to many concerts in different countries, including the UK and Singapore. I love the feeling I have at a concert  <strong><tagname style="color:red">where live music is more touching</tagname></strong>, I was at a concert quite recently, when I went to see Guns and Roses perform in Lisbon.</p>
<h2 id="tea-and-coffee">Tea and coffee</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do Chinese people like to drink tea or coffee?<br>
I think more Chinese people prefer to drink tea than coffee. I know my family does. There are so many more flavours of tea that people can enjoy, and that’s why it is more popular.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think most Chinese people drink both tea and coffee. However, coffee is  <strong><tagname style="color:red">more common</tagname></strong> to drink early in the morning, while tea is something you can drink  <strong><tagname style="color:red">all day long</tagname></strong>. Tea is a bit of a  <strong><tagname style="color:red">comforting drink</tagname></strong>, as well.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you prepare tea or coffee for the guests at home?<br>
I prepare and serve tea for guests at home. My mother will make coffee for the few guests who prefer coffee, because I don’t know how to make it properly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever I have people <strong><tagname style="color:red">pay me a visit</tagname></strong>, I usually make them a cup of tea. <strong><tagname style="color:red">This is especially true if they stop by</tagname></strong> for dinner or simply in the afternoon.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When was the last time you drank tea or coffee?<br>
I drank some green tea this morning. I have tea every morning. When I get home from school, I will often have an herbal tea. I have only tried coffee once, and frankly, I just don’t like it. It tastes very bitter to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to confess, I' ve had tea and coffee today. This morning, I had a latte for breakfast. I also  <strong><tagname style="color:red">washed my lunch down with</tagname></strong> a cup of green tea. They were both delicious.</p>
<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like to take photos?<br>
In truth,  <strong><tagname style="color:red">I am not the sort of person who</tagname></strong> would go around <strong><tagname style="color:red">snapping photos or selfies</tagname></strong>. I only do so when I want to <strong><tagname style="color:red">capture a special moment</tagname></strong>, and I would use my phones camera instead of a professional one Good for me that taking photos these days is <strong><tagname style="color:red">as easy as pie</tagname></strong>, otherwise I would end up without a single picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer to take photos yourself or to have other people take photos?<br>
I usually have other people take photos for me. I <strong><tagname style="color:red">somehow</tagname></strong> trust they would  <strong><tagname style="color:red">render better pictures than me</tagname></strong>. Photography  <strong><tagname style="color:red">has never been</tagname></strong> my strength, which is why I <strong><tagname style="color:red">would rather</tagname></strong> let others do it. Then I get them to send me the photos which I keep on my phone and only rarely develop at the photo studio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you take photos?<br>
I don't take photos quite often. There must be a special event or moment to <strong><tagname style="color:red">prompt me to snap a picture</tagname></strong>. It could be something funny, or even a beautiful view out in nature. All in all, I can say I take photos <strong><tagname style="color:red">once in a blue moon</tagname></strong>. <strong><tagname style="color:red">It's just not my cup of tea</tagname></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what situations do you take photos?<br>
Special events such as parties, celebrations and gatherings are <strong><tagname style="color:red">worth remembering</tagname></strong> so I take photos <strong><tagname style="color:red">during these</tagname></strong>. In addition, I might also photograph interesting places <strong><tagname style="color:red">if</tagname></strong> I am on a trip abroad. However, I <strong><tagname style="color:red">avoid taking</tagname></strong> pictures that <strong><tagname style="color:red">reveal my daily routine</tagname></strong>. I think such photos don't have any <strong><tagname style="color:red">added value</tagname></strong>, plus I believe they are <strong><tagname style="color:red">too</tagname></strong> personal <strong><tagname style="color:red">to</tagname></strong> share with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you keep your photos?<br>
I store most of my photos on my smartphone. I have an empty album at home but I have <strong><tagname style="color:red">yet</tagname></strong> to <strong><tagname style="color:red">develop some photos and fill it in</tagname></strong>. I prefer to <strong><tagname style="color:red">store the pictures electronically</tagname></strong> because they cannot be <strong><tagname style="color:red">mutilated</tagname></strong>. Plus, I have the photos with me at all times so I can show them to others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="patience">Patience</h2>
<ol>
<li>Were you patient when you were young?<br>
No, I was not patient at all when I was young. I remember having trouble waiting for meals and interrupting my parents for attention when they were busy. I cried and shouted when I was impatient and could not be quiet at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a kid, I was <strong><tagname style="color:red">the opposite of patient</tagname></strong>. It was <strong><tagname style="color:red">as tough as nails</tagname></strong> for me to <strong><tagname style="color:red">sit still and wait for anything had to put a lot of work</tagname></strong> into this aspect of my life.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How do you feel when other people are not patient?<br>
When younger children are impatient, it doesn’t bother me because I understand they are still learning. However, I get upset when older children and adults aren’t patient. It’s important to be respectful of other people.</li>
</ol>
<p>When an adult isn‘t patient, I find it very frustrating. Impatience only makes a situation <strong><tagname style="color:red">more complicated</tagname></strong>. However, I <strong><tagname style="color:red">can't help but</tagname></strong> empathise with children that <strong><tagname style="color:red">have ants in their pants</tagname></strong>, because they have so much energy.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Were you less or more patience when you are angry?<br>
I am more patient when I am angry. This is because I always walk away until I am calmer. Then, I won’t do or say things that I may regret later. Walking away forces me to be calmer, so then I will be more patient.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'li admit, when I'm angry, my patience often <strong><tagname style="color:red">goes out the door</tagname></strong>. I try to <strong><tagname style="color:red">keep my cool</tagname></strong>, but if I am <strong><tagname style="color:red">pushed too far</tagname></strong>, then I find it hard to deal with situations that require patience.</p>
<h2 id="public-holiday">Public holiday</h2>
<ol>
<li>How many public holidays do you have in China?<br>
There are seven public holidays we can enjoy in China. If it’s counted by days, there are 11 public holidays each year. For some of the Chinese, they can enjoy one or half a day for their own holiday. For example, Chinese women enjoy half a day on Women’s Day.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seven public holidays and China. These holidays include the Spring Festival, National Day and New Year, <strong><tagname style="color:red">just to name a few</tagname></strong>. Of course, each holiday is important to our country, because it celebrates our culture.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you think people need more public holidays?<br>
In my opinion, I think people need more public holidays in China. With more and more work and study burden, Chinese people have less time to enjoy their own hobbies or to attend their family activities nowadays. In addition, more holidays can encourage people to travel more.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we <strong><tagname style="color:red">could use more</tagname></strong> holidays. I love to celebrate with my family, friends and community while <strong><tagname style="color:red">enjoying the spirit of a special occasion</tagname></strong>. Holidays give people the chance to <strong><tagname style="color:red">kick back and relax too</tagname></strong>, which is important.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How do you usually spend your holidays?<br>
Usually I spend my holidays with my family or my friends. I often gather with family at a restaurant for a morning tea or a meal. Sometimes I will go to the cinema with my good friends for a movie. If I have more holidays, I would rather travel with my family or friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, when there is a holiday, my parents and I go to my grandparents' home. Then, we eat a ton of food, play games and enjoy a community event. This often includes setting off and watching fireworks.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which holiday is your favourite?<br>
My favourite holiday, without a doubt, is the Spring Festival which is our Chinese New Year. This is a traditional Chinese festival and it’s the most important holidays for Chinese families. Normally, no matter where we are, we go home to meet our parents and grandparents during these days in a year.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favourite holiday is the Spring Festival. There is something <strong><tagname style="color:red">refreshing</tagname></strong> about greeting a new year. Plus, I love spending time with family, <strong><tagname style="color:red">passing out red envelopes</tagname></strong> and eating delicious foods.</p>
<h2 id="outdoor">Outdoor</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you prefer to be indoors or outdoors?<br>
Personally, I prefer being outdoors rather than indoors. It feels great to go outside and exercise a bit to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I go to the gym once a week to keep fit and get slimmer. I also do yoga at home for two hours after dinner.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have developed a habit of relaxing indoors, especially on  <strong><tagname style="color:red">workdays</tagname></strong>. However, when I am on vacation, the great outdoors is my personal <strong><tagname style="color:red">oasis</tagname></strong>. <strong><tagname style="color:red">I can't get enough of the</tagname></strong> sunshine and scenic views.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Did you like to go outside when you were young?<br>
I loved to go outside when I was young. There was a park nearby my house when I was in primary school, and my parents would often bring me over there to have fun with my friends. We could spend the whole day in the park without getting bored.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I was a kid, I was often <strong><tagname style="color:red">tempted to</tagname></strong> stay indoors and play video games. Once I worked up the motivation to go outside, <strong><tagname style="color:red">I had a blast</tagname></strong>, though. I always felt much <strong><tagname style="color:red">happier</tagname></strong> after spending the day outdoors.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Did you often go over to your friends’ house when you were young?<br>
Yes, I did. My friends invite me to their houses quite a lot and I’ve developed a good relationship with their parents. They often treat me with food and drinks and chat with me about interesting things about their work. The things I learned from them were fascinating.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">As soon as</tagname></strong> I was old enough to <strong><tagname style="color:red">venture out on my own</tagname></strong>, I spent a lot of time with my friends. We would take turns going to each others houses, which helped to keep things fresh and exciting.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is it important for children to play outdoors?<br>
I think it’s really important for people to encourage their children to play outdoors. Having some outdoor activities could keep children healthy and strong. Playing outdoors would also help them release some stress that was built during long time studies and school work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Absolutely! Playing outside <strong><tagname style="color:red">is a great way for</tagname></strong> children to get some exercise, learn and <strong><tagname style="color:red">use their imagination</tagname></strong>. <strong><tagname style="color:red">Apart from that</tagname></strong>, fresh air and sunshine are both vital to our health and the best place to get both is outside.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you make plans every day?<br>
Not necessarily. I make plans for myself about things that I must complete each day, and I would mark off any tasks that I’ve completed after doing it. However, I don’t really specify what time I would complete it because it doesn’t really matter to me as long as I complete it in the specified date.</li>
</ol>
<p>I actually <strong><tagname style="color:red">tend to wing it</tagname></strong>  most of the time. I would love to be a <strong><tagname style="color:red">planner</tagname></strong>, but usually, <strong><tagname style="color:red">things don't go according to plan</tagname></strong>, which frustrates me greatly. So, I just <strong><tagname style="color:red">let things flow naturally</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are you good at managing your time?<br>
I’m pretty good at managing my time. I often estimate the amount of time that’s required to finish a certain task, and save some time between each task as little breaks.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to admit; time management <strong><tagname style="color:red">isn't my cup of tea</tagname></strong>. I tend to <strong><tagname style="color:red">space out</tagname></strong> often and <strong><tagname style="color:red">lose track of time</tagname></strong>. I also work better when I procrastinate, as it forces me to concentrate harder.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the latest plan you’ve made?<br>
Just a few days ago, a childhood friend of mine that I haven’t seen for a long time contacted me on social media， asking me to go to a reunion party and see my old primary school friends at a restaurant. It has been quite some time since we parted ways after graduating primary school, so I made plans with them and wrote it in my agenda.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last plan I made was to go home to visit my grandparents. <strong><tagname style="color:red">I hadn't seen them</tagname></strong> in a little while, so I <strong><tagname style="color:red">cleared my schedule</tagname></strong> and planned out the best travel route to <strong><tagname style="color:red">maximise</tagname></strong> my time with them.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What is the hardest part about making plans?<br>
The hardest part about making plans for me is when something unexpected occurs and disrupts my original plan. I get stood up by some friends sometimes, because they only tell me an hour before the meetups. It’s really hard to adapt to the sudden change in plan, but I manage to work them out in the end.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the hardest aspect of planning is <strong><tagname style="color:red">working out the kinks of each plan</tagname></strong>. You never know what is going to go wrong, so you really have to plan around a bunch of different factors, including the weather.</p>
<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you often use a calculator?<br>
Yes. I do often use a calculator because I feel that it is much faster and convenient when I am doing my Math exercises. Especially when I am solving some complicated algebra questions, a functional calculator can be used as a useful tool for it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">Ever since </tagname></strong> I figured out there is a calculator on my smartphone, I tend to use it frequently. It especially <strong><tagname style="color:red">comes in handy</tagname></strong> when I'm shopping, as it allows me to calculate my purchases before checking out.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are girls generally good at mathematics?<br>
General speaking, girls are not as good as boys at mathematics, especially in the past. But nowadays, there are more and more girls who are interested in the field of Science and Engineering. Some of them are better than boys in the Math study and even at their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel that girls are just <strong><tagname style="color:red">as good at math as boys are</tagname></strong>. However, for years, there was a <strong><tagname style="color:red">stigma</tagname></strong> about mathematics and girls. So, many girls didn't <strong><tagname style="color:red">put in the effort</tagname></strong> needed to excel in the subject.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you think it is difficult to learn mathematics well?<br>
Yes. To learn mathematics well requires at least three main factors: interest, diligence, and some degree of abilities in abstract thinking and understanding. This is because compared with other subjects, Math involves more abstract concepts and logical inferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematics can be a <strong><tagname style="color:red">challenging</tagname></strong> subject. However, I feel that a person's motivation as well as the teachers they have throughout their education plays an important role in how they view the subject.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think mathematics is important?<br>
Mathematics is an important basic course for students to study because it educates and trains students for their comprehensive ability in abstract thinking, analysis and deduction. It is also the basic tool of the study in all science and engineering. And it plays an important role in the development of human society and propels the society forward.</li>
</ol>
<p>Absolutely. Mathematics not only helps people to understand so much about the world, <strong><tagname style="color:red">but</tagname></strong> it is also a <strong><tagname style="color:red">necessity</tagname></strong> for the future. Without this subject, we would not have the technology or knowledge that we do today.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Do you like travelling?<br>
Yes, I really enjoy travelling, especially by myself. It’s a great way to release all the stress built up at school. I go on some trips to different cities nearby every year during the summer break. I book and order all the tickets and flights by myself, and it’s more affordable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I love traveling. I do enjoy seeing the world from great historical monuments to white sandy beaches. Travelling is a very interesting way to learn about new cultures and explore new places.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Which cities have you travelled to?<br>
I’ve been to places like Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing. I enjoyed all the sceneries and food during my trip. I’m still a student, I can’t afford to go to other countries and travel by myself. But I’ve been to Kyoto, Japan with my parents. It was a great family trip and we had a lot of fun there together.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have traveled to many different parts of China recently and I enjoyed the trips a lot. <strong><tagname style="color:red">To be more specific</tagname></strong>, my last visit was to Shenzhen, which is called Silicon Valley of China.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What kind of cities do you like to travel to?<br>
I like going to the cities that I could try a lot of delicious food. I really enjoy trying out different food from different cities and experiencing the diffident cultures from places. You could also learn about the histories of places as you have the food. A lot of food such as stinky tofu can date back to Ancient China.</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, I am a big fan of history, so I love to visit <strong><tagname style="color:red">historical cities</tagname></strong> in China, such as Beijing and Xian. Traveling to those cities <strong><tagname style="color:red">enables me to</tagname></strong> explore the great history and traditional culture.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What is the place that left you the deepest impression when travelling?<br>
Japan is probably the most impressive country I’ve ever been to. The clean streets and the politeness of the people have left me the deepest impressions. There was absolutely no garbage that was left on the ground, and all the places I’ve been to were extremely clean and tidy. People were also very polite when they interact with each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, Xian is an amazing city impressing me a lot. It has a history of over 6000 years and had been the capital of countries for 1200 years. There are lots of ancient attractions, such as the Terracotta Warriors, big wild goose pagoda and Famen Temple.</p>
<h2 id="market">Market</h2>
<ol>
<li>What do street markets sell?<br>
Out of all the street markets I’ve been to, almost all of them sell authentic Chinese street food, such as stinky tofu in Hunan, Changfen in Guangdong and other foods that are special in each continent. Street food are usually made to order and offered in smaller sizes for your convenience.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">I've seen</tagname></strong> just about everything sold at a street market. You can find produce, meats, snacks, clothes, handicrafts and electronics. These little markets are truly <strong><tagname style="color:red">remarkable</tagname></strong>, and they help <strong><tagname style="color:red">keep the culture alive</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are there many street markets in China?<br>
There are quite a lot of street markets in China. If you go out on the streets in the middle of the night, you could see hundreds of people still sitting on the side of the streets, savouring the snacks they’ve bought from the vendors. It’s an unspoken tradition for people to have midnight snacks in China.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are street markets everywhere in China. In the countryside, farmers sell their produce, meats and baked goods. In cities, you can find these things and so much more. There are even a few markets that are <strong><tagname style="color:red">world-famous</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What are the differences between street markets and supermarkets?<br>
Supermarkets tend to sell food that’s made using machines, such as frozen foods and boxed snacks. However, if you go to a local street market in China, you could find tons of homemade and authentic Chinese street food sold in different vendors. They are also cheaper than the frozen food sold in the supermarkets.</li>
</ol>
<p>Supermarkets <strong><tagname style="color:red">tend to be</tagname></strong> a large establishment that is <strong><tagname style="color:red">filled with</tagname></strong> groceries, toiletries and more. Street markets are <strong><tagname style="color:red">private vendors</tagname></strong> that sell items that they grow, make or sell in their own store.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you often go to the supermarkets?<br>
I do. Even though supermarkets have a lot of frozen foods in the freezers, they still sell fresh produces. Living alone as a student, I go to the supermarkets once every week to stock up fresh produces in my fridge. I make most of my meals every week, other than the times where I’m incredibly tired after school</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever I need to get a lot of items, I <strong><tagname style="color:red">tend to</tagname></strong> go to the supermarket. There, I can buy easy to make meals, as well as the toiletries and groceries that I need to make life convenient.</p>
<h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>
<ol>
<li>What do you think makes good friends?<br>
I think the most important thing about a good friend is the sincerity. If you want to become a good friend, it’s important to actually be sincere in this relationship, and don’t hesitate to show your genuineness to your friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good friends <strong><tagname style="color:red">walk the talks</tagname></strong> and show that they care by actions. They are always there for you <strong><tagname style="color:red">no matter what happens</tagname></strong>, and they don't <strong><tagname style="color:red">judge you</tagname></strong> and are trustworthy and willing to tell you the truth, even when it's hard for you to hear.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you keep in contact with friends from your childhood?<br>
I’m actually not in contact with my friends from my childhood anymore. I have their contacts on social media, and I see their posts once in a while, however, we don’t message one another anymore, because it has been so long since the last time I talked to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, actually I <strong><tagname style="color:red">have known</tagname></strong> my best friend for almost 12 years <strong><tagname style="color:red">since</tagname></strong> childhood. We are not living the same city right now, but we keep having a video call once a week, to update and have fun with each other.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What kinds of people do you like to make friends with?<br>
I like to make friends with people who are energetic and playful. I enjoy having company so I won’t get too bored during the days. I also like making friends with people who have the same interest as me, because it helps create more topics when having conversations.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will love to <strong><tagname style="color:red">make friends with</tagname></strong> people who are outgoing and trustworthy. It will be <strong><tagname style="color:red">better</tagname></strong> that we <strong><tagname style="color:red">share the common interests</tagname></strong>, so we can hang out often to <strong><tagname style="color:red">build stronger friendships</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think you are a good friend or others?<br>
I think I am a good friend to others, because I am cheerful and I don’t get angry easily. I often joke around with friends, and I’m usually the mood-maker in my group of friends. So I think my friends love to have my company.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that many people <strong><tagname style="color:red">regard me as</tagname></strong> a good friend, as I am outgoing, trustworthy and willing to help them by actions. Also, I can tell you that they like me, as they are always happy to help me.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<ol>
<li>What’s your favourite movie?<br>
I have quite a lot of favorite movies, but my most favorite movie would definitely be Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse. It has great graphics and plot, which makes it suitable for all ages to watch. I’ve watched it over five times since it came out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Iron Man is my favourite movie because it is one of the best super heroes of Marvel Comics, has amazing <strong><tagname style="color:red">special effects</tagname></strong> and humour and the character is always ironic and also the actor Robert is super handsome.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do your friends like this movie?<br>
Of course, all of my friends who watched it told me they loved it. I went to watch this movie with a friend, and after the movie, we couldn’t stop talking about how great the animation and graphics were, and how beautiful the plot and character settings were.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that many of my friends love this movie, as they shared the movies in Wechat many times, and they kept talking how handsome and fantastic Iron Man is.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What kinds of movies do you think young people like<br>
I think young people would like movies that have more action and drama. These genres tend to allow young adults to stay focused on the movie, because it’s exciting and attention-grabbing. Movies like a documentary would probably put young people to sleep.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, it depends on person to person and I can't say a general statement about everyone. As far as I am concerned, I prefer movies <strong><tagname style="color:red">based on social issues</tagname></strong>, and most of my friends are crazy for action movies.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you want to be a movie star?<br>
I used to want to become a movie actor when I was young. I was featured in a school play back when I was in primary school. However, I don’t think I have the ability to become a movie star now that I’ve grown up, and I have no experience in acting ever since elementary.</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually I <strong><tagname style="color:red">used to</tagname></strong> imagine to be a super movie star when I was a kid, as I thought that movie star would earn lots of money and have millions of fans. <strong><tagname style="color:red">However</tagname></strong>, I start to understand the challenges with age, such as <strong><tagname style="color:red">lack of privacy and stress</tagname></strong>, and I don't want to be it anymore.</p>
<h2 id="animals">Animals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever kept pets?<br>
I once had a poodle when I was in primary school. I named her Kuro, which means Black in Japanese. She was only six months old when it joined our family. Unfortunately, we had to send her away after a few weeks, because we noticed my mom getting allergic reactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I used to raise a dog called Lulu, and its body looked like a sausage, slim and long. I liked it a lot and <strong><tagname style="color:red">walked it almost every day</tagname></strong>. Unfortunately, it got lost during the Spring Festival, and my heart was broken.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you like to go to the zoo?<br>
I really like to go to the zoo, because I get to see rare animals that people don’t often see in their daily lives. It’s awesome to see different animals that I’ve never seen before, and every time I go to the zoo, I realise that there’s way more animals in this world than I imagined.</li>
</ol>
<p>I used to like to visit animals at the zoo, but they seemed so sad. Zoo officials often <strong><tagname style="color:red">consider profits ahead of the animals well-being</tagname></strong>. Many animals who naturally live in large herds or family groups are often kept alone or, at most, in pairs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have you ever seen any wild animals before?<br>
I’ve seen a wild red fox when I was on a vacation with my mom to Canada. My mom and I were talking and taking a stroll that day, and we stopped talking and stood in shock when we saw the fox, casually walking past us on a street, only a few meters away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I once saw a snake when I was having fun in my grandmas garden. The snake was in black and the head was quite big and looked like a spoon. I was so scared that I couldn't move at all.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What wild animals do you like most?<br>
I really like clouded leopards (云豹). Clouded leopards are medium sized cats that are beautiful and majestic. They don’t have strong roars like some of the big cats, which makes them cute at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tiger is my favourite animal, <strong><tagname style="color:red">ever since</tagname></strong> I was little I have always been drawn to tigers. I like its appearance and physical power. In my opinion they are just the perfect animal. The most supreme of the big cats while also being just <strong><tagname style="color:red">as beautiful as</tagname></strong> they are dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<ol>
<li>What languages can you speak?<br>
I speak Chinese and English. Chinese is my first language and English is my second language. I’ve been trying to learn a little Japanese by myself during the summer break, but I haven’t progressed much, because I don’t have a lot of Japanese friends to have conversations with.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mandarin is my mother tongue. <strong><tagname style="color:red">I've always lived</tagname></strong> in China, and my home region is pretty monolingual <strong><tagname style="color:red">Besides</tagname></strong>, I have learned English as a second language for five years, and sometimes I use English to communicate with friends and family.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you think it is difficult to learn a new language?<br>
I think it’s not that difficult to learn a new language. The most important thing about learning a new language is to practice. I like to learn a new language by watching TV and having conversations with friends. It doesn’t matter if you can’t speak fluently yet, because mistakes help you grow faster.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that <strong><tagname style="color:red">picking up a second language</tagname></strong> gets more difficult with age. <strong><tagname style="color:red">You know</tagname></strong>, languages are constructed <strong><tagname style="color:red">in terms of</tagname></strong> their own rules and even those closely related have much in common but also great variation in grammar and spelling. Speaking one is no guarantee of understanding another.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Will you learn other languages in the future?<br>
I wish I could learn Japanese in the future. I’ve been checking out a lot of videos about the different cultures in Japan, and I wish to go to Japan on a vacation in the future. Learning Japanese before going on the trip would come in handy.</li>
</ol>
<p>I aspire to be a polyglot in the future, and I'm already learning both English and Mandarin. I would love to learn Korean entirely in the future <strong><tagname style="color:red">so that</tagname></strong> someday I would be able to watch my favourite dramas <strong><tagname style="color:red">without</tagname></strong> following the stories by reading subtitles.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Why do you learn English?<br>
I learn English because English <strong><tagname style="color:red">has become</tagname></strong> the most spoken language on the planet, it has become a universal language. By learning English, I would be able to speak decent English with people from other countries without expressing my message incorrectly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="voice">Voice</h2>
<ol>
<li>Has your voice ever changed?<br>
My voice had changed quite hard as I grew up. My voice used to be pretty high pitched when I was young, but as I grew up, it started getting deeper and deeper. In the end, my voice turned quite deep, which is very different compared to my voice when I was young.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I started my <strong><tagname style="color:red">puberty</tagname></strong>, my voice began to <strong><tagname style="color:red">deepen</tagname></strong>. At the beginning, that resulted in a weird sound that I did not like. But, with time it became what it is now, which I like.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you enjoy recording your voice and listening to it?<br>
I don’t really listen to my voice in a recording, because it sounds a lot different to how I actually sound in real life. I find that voice recordings tend to make my voice go higher pitched, which sounds really cute, and I’m actually not really used to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am <strong><tagname style="color:red">indifferent</tagname></strong> to record my voice and to listen to it. However, sometimes, when I log my voice and listen to it, it does not feel like the voice I hear when I speak. I do not like the sound my voice has when recorded.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like your own voice?<br>
I really like my own voice. When I talk slowly with confidence, I think it gives an impression to people that I’m mature and thoughtful. I also like singing because I like my own voice; however, I never record my own singing because it sounds really weird in recordings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I like my voice. My voice is quite normal, not too high and not too low, but it tends to be <strong><tagname style="color:red">on the lower spectrum</tagname></strong>. However, when I listen to my voice recorded by a device, I do not like its sound that much.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Does your voice sound similar to your parents?<br>
Surprisingly, my voice sounds nothing like my parents. My mom has a really high-pitched tone, while my dad has a mediocre voice that’s not really deep. My parents often joked that I didn’t sound like their kid back when I was in high school.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="concentration">Concentration</h2>
<ol>
<li>When do you need to be focused?<br>
Currently I need to focus on my university study. Since my major is visual arts, I need to spend most of the time on projects and homework. Concentration on study is my priority for these four years.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I work and when I play. Naturally, if I am focused when I work, I am more efficient, and, hence, <strong><tagname style="color:red">more productive</tagname></strong>. I also need to be focused when I play, because <strong><tagname style="color:red">I am a competitive person</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What many distract you when you are trying to stay focused?<br>
To be honest, too much chatting online with friends is distracting me when I am trying to stay focused on my school study. Wechat is a good communication tool for today’s young generation, however, I am trying to control the time I spend on it every day.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">Typically</tagname></strong>, messages from the messaging application that I use at study. Some days, I keep receiving messages that draw my attention away from the study that I am doing. Also, emails are <strong><tagname style="color:red">a source of distraction every now and then</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What do you do to help you concentrate?<br>
In order to keep my concentration on study, I usually shut down my cellphone or go to the library to study for a few hours. Besides, I often find a study room at school where no friends can find me. In this way, I can focus on my homework by myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Silence. I like to study in a quiet environment because I think more clearly and can keep my focus for a longer time. Sometimes, listening to piano or acoustic music helps me concentrate, as well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is it difficult for you to stay focused on something?<br>
Yes. When there are so many friends chatting with me online or hanging out together, it is difficult for me to stay focused on my study. When I am captivated with my favourite animation, I cannot concentrate on my homework at home. In general, I have difficulty to stay focused on something for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>It depends on what I am doing. Usually, it is easier to stay focused if I am doing something that I like As an example, I like mathematics, and when I work on it, I can focus on it effectively for long times.</p>
<h2 id="jeans">Jeans</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you wear jeans?<br>
Yes. I usually wear jeans when I hang out with my friends. We often go for hiking, dancing and seeing movies during our holidays. Wearing jeans is a kind of fashion trend for today’s young generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I wear jeans many times, and I like jeans. They are both comfortable and fashionable. I love the standard color that jeans have, that is blue.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How often do you wear jeans?<br>
I often wear jeans at weekends, especially every Saturday. Since Saturday is a leisure time for me to relax after a week’s study at school. During my vacations and holidays, I also like to wear jeans to go travel with my family.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wear jeans quite often. I find them comfortable and, at the same time, they look good. I typically wear jeans that tend to be skinny, <strong><tagname style="color:red">rather than</tagname></strong> loose.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like wearing jeans, why?<br>
I like wearing jeans because it shows my body figure perfectly. And it is also a fashion trend for our young generation. I also like wearing jeans because they’re stylish. Furthermore, they are always leading the trend of the casual wears.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I do like wearing jeans. The jeans that I wear are both comfortable and fashionable. I mostly wear blue jeans, both in light and dark colors.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Why do you think jeans are popular in China?<br>
In China, people like to wear jeans in all kinds of occasions, formal and informal, weekdays and weekends, indoors and outdoors. The other reason I think jeans are popular in China is because people from older to younger generations like to wear jeans no matter if it is in winter or in summer. And there are a lot of stores and shops selling jeans everywhere in China.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jeans are popular because they are both comfortable and look good with many other clothes. So, it the combination of comfortable and style that make them such an item of versatile clothing, which, in turn, gives jeans their popularity.</p>
<h2 id="haircut">Haircut</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What’s your favourite hairstyle?<br>
My favourite hairstyle is short straight hair. Since I am living in Southern China, it is extremely hot in summer. And I sweat a lot when it is hot. So a short straight hair style is suitable and favourable to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you have your hair cut?<br>
My short straight hair style helps me to avoid going to the barber, so I go much less than my friends. I only have my hair cut every two weeks. Since I am currently studying in the university, I do not have too much money and time to keep changing my hairstyle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, every four to six weeks. In general, when my hair feels too hard to comb and fix, I go to the hairdresser.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>How much do you usually spend on your haircut?<br>
I usually spend only one hundred yuan a month for my haircut. Every two weeks, it costs me fifty yuan to go to barber. It is a reasonable price for a simple hair cut nowadays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you often change your haircut?<br>
No. I am not keen on changing my hairstyle, especially as I am a student currently. I need to concentrate on my school study all the time so that I can find a good job after graduation. Then I will think about changing my haircut or hairstyle more often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you had your current haircut?<br>
I have had my current haircut for at least two years since I entered into the university. I would like to focus on the study instead of my appearance for the coming two years in the school. And this is also because the weather in Guangzhou is terribly hot in summer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have had my current haircut for about four weeks. I think I will wait another two weeks before cutting it because it is still short.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Have you ever had an unhappy haircut?<br>
Yes. I remember that in the summer vacation during my high school I was unhappy with my haircut. I was going back to my hometown with my parents. Since it is in the countryside, it is really hard for me to find a good barber. So I had to accept what the only barber in the village had done to my hair.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had an unhappy haircut experience several times. I typically explain to the hairdresser what haircut I would like to have in details and also show them a picture. However, it is often the case that they cut my hair way too short in comparison to my description and the picture.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Do you like to have your hair cut?<br>
Yes. I do like to have my hair cut. But I do not like to change my hairstyle too often. My favourite hairstyle is the short straight hair, and I do not like to have my hair dyed into other colours.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like to have a haircut because it feels like a head massage. Sometimes, while I am having a haircut, I close my eyes and relax to enjoy the experience, and, when I do it, time flies.</p>
<h2 id="walking">Walking</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you walk a lot?<br>
I do not walk a lot because I am not very interested in outdoor activities. In fact, I enjoy indoor exercises, such as Yoga, Aerobics and table tennis. I would like to take a walk only if I have eaten too much at dinner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I love walking, Walking can provide numerous health benefits to <strong><tagname style="color:red">people of all ages and fitness levels</tagname></strong> . It may also help prevent certain diseases and even prolong life.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Do you walk more often than in the past?<br>
No. Since I am studying visual arts in the university, I have less time to go out for a walk. A lot of projects and homework I have to work on not only in the day, but also at night. I spend a lot of time on shopping, chatting and studying online instead of any outdoor activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people will walk more or not in the future?<br>
I think more and more people will walk less in the future. With the development of AI and different kinds of apps in cellphones, people do not need to walk more to get what they want. They can order everything online, meeting and chatting with friends by video calls. AI will meet their needs for indoor and outdoor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To be honest, I am not sure about that. I know that the benefits of walking have raised a lot of peoples attention. However, the development of technology reduces the cost of vehicles; more and more people tend to use them rather than walking.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Where do you usually take a walk?<br>
I usually take a walk in the park near my home. The park is a small but clean place for people to spend their leisure time, especially for the older generation. I like to take a walk over there because my parents like to be with me while they take a walk after dinner.</li>
</ol>
<p>I usually walk around Shenzhen Bay on my own two feet to appreciate all the parks, sights and delights that Shenzhen has to offer.</p>
<h2 id="countryside">Countryside</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like to live in countryside in the future?<br>
Yes. Although I am currently living in the city, I still like would to move to the countryside someday when I have my own family. This is because I would like to have a bigger space and a clean and healthy living environment for my baby to grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would you like to do in the countryside?<br>
Living in the countryside, I would like to farm my own vegetable in my backyard so that I can eat healthy foods planted by myself every day. And I would like to raise and walk a dog in the field instead of keeping it at home. The most important thing I would like to do in the countryside is to breathe the fresh air while I am doing exercises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you lived in countryside?<br>
To be honest, I have only lived in countryside for a few days. It was because I went to my hometown to see my cousin with my parents. When I saw the green field, beautiful flowers and the little hill behind our old house in the countryside, I was attracted by the peaceful, quiet and healthy living environment over there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the benefits of living in rural areas?<br>
Living in rural areas, you can breathe the fresh air, have a bigger living space and healthier food than living in the cities. Besides, you can also have a quiet and peaceful quality of life. Less people and less pollution are also the advantages of living in rural areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you ever lived in the countryside?<br>
Yes, I used to live in the countryside when I was a kid. It did provide me with a peaceful life. There were lots of outdoor activities for me as well, such as camping and fishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you usually do in the countryside?<br>
When I lived in the countryside, I often planted some flowers in the yard. Besides, I also raised livestock such as dogs, cats and chicken. What's more, I was fond of getting together and chatting with neighbours after dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you live in the countryside in the future? /Do you enjoy living in the countryside?<br>
Although the countryside is less crowded and the air tends to be better, I don't want to live there Because it has fewer opportunities, and public services and transportation in the countryside are not developed at all. I prefer to live in a big city.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="新题">新题</h1>
<h2 id="scenery">Scenery</h2>
<ol>
<li>Is there good scenery in your hometown?<br>
Yes, of course. There are many famous tourist attractions in my hometown, such as the Canton Tower, Pearl River and Baiyun Mountain. But I have been to these places so many times that they are not as attractive to me anymore.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course. My hometown is one of the most famous tourist destinations in China. <strong><tagname style="color:red">It features both breathtaking natural scenery like mountains, lakes and forests and city skyline shaped by various skyscrapers</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When you travel, do you like to live in hotels with scenic views?<br>
No, I don’t. Because the hotels with scenic views are usually very expensive. I can go to the scenery in the daytime even though it will take me a little time to get there. I think staying in expensive hotels is a high cost way to travel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, who doesn't t? <strong><tagname style="color:red">Even though</tagname></strong> hotels with scenic views <strong><tagname style="color:red">charge more money than ordinary ones</tagname></strong>, I prefer to stay in a hotel room with a large window. When I traveled to the Lake District in Britain, I spent an <strong><tagname style="color:red">expensive yet comfortable</tagname></strong> night at the Swan Hotel. The big glass window invites us to an unforgettable scene of crystal clear lakes and deep blue sky. <strong><tagname style="color:red">The beauty is beyond words</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like to take pictures of good scenery with your smartphone? Why?<br>
I like to use my smartphone to take pictures. My Huawei P30 has incredible photography functions. While on the journey, I always use my Huawei cellphone to take pictures for my friends. All of them are always astonished by the good effects of the pictures.</li>
</ol>
<p>I dislike pictures taken by my smartphone. I prefer to use professional cameras because with smartphone, <strong><tagname style="color:red">everything is set in an auto mode with no flexibility</tagname></strong>. <strong><tagname style="color:red">Yet </tagname></strong> what we see with our eyes is full of colours, subtle changes and surprises. The pictures taken with the smartphone is too &quot;smart &quot; to capture the <strong><tagname style="color:red">authentic natural beauty </tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is there good scenery in cities?<br>
It depends. I think a skyline of skyscrapers is good scenery which I appreciate. But some people don’t, they may consider natural landscape as the best kind of scenery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, many <strong><tagname style="color:red">metropolises</tagname></strong> are well-known for their unique urban scenery. For example, all the Japanese cities present charming sunsets with orange and pink shadows. <strong><tagname style="color:red">Not to mention</tagname></strong> the overwhelming city skyline of Manhattan in the New York City, <strong><tagname style="color:red">where</tagname></strong> tall buildings in various shapes <strong><tagname style="color:red">race to touch the sky</tagname></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="pen-and-pencil">Pen and pencil</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you usually use pen and pencil?<br>
No, I seldom use pen or pencil because I like to use the computer to read and do my study. I think typing through the computer is more convenient.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am <strong><tagname style="color:red">more accustomed to</tagname></strong> using a pen. I majored in translation and interpretation, <strong><tagname style="color:red">which</tagname></strong> requires a lot of note-taking, <strong><tagname style="color:red">especially in terms of</tagname></strong> interpretation. With a pen, I can write quickly and clearly, which is <strong><tagname style="color:red">not the case with</tagname></strong> a pen.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Which do you use more often? Pen or pencil?<br>
Pen, of course. The cartridge of the pencil is so fragile that it often breaks off easily. However, pen is much more durable, even if you drop it to the ground many times, it still works.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compared with pencil, pen is my <strong><tagname style="color:red">everyday writing tool</tagname></strong>. All official examinations in China require to write the answers with black pen. Using a pencil in an exam <strong><tagname style="color:red">is against the rule</tagname></strong> and you may fail the exam because of it. So I use a pen more often just to train myself to be comfortable with using pens.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When was the last time you bought a pen or pencil?<br>
I don’t remember actually. Now I have several pens on hand. All of them were given as a present in school activities. So, I haven’t bought a pen for long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a long time ago <strong><tagname style="color:red">when</tagname></strong> I was still a high school student. <strong><tagname style="color:red">Back in senior high</tagname></strong>, my school has <strong><tagname style="color:red">a total ban on any digital devices</tagname></strong> like smartphones and computers. We all did homework with a pen. Since college, I prefer to do my homework on the computer <strong><tagname style="color:red">rather than</tagname></strong> write my answers on a paper.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What do you think if someone gives you a pen or pencil as a present?<br>
I think it is old-fashion way to give a pen or pencil as a present. If someone did that, I would accept it, but I wouldn’t be happy about that.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will be very pleased to be given a pen as a present. In fact, I once bought a Lamy pen for my bestie as her birthday gift. Chinese people pay special attention to handwriting <strong><tagname style="color:red">because we have long history of calligraphy</tagname></strong>. Therefore, I think it is nice to get a pen and I will see it <strong><tagname style="color:red">as a reminder</tagname></strong> of old days when everyone tries to improve their handwriting instead of typing on a PC.</p>
<h2 id="spend-time-by-yourself">Spend time by yourself</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you like to be alone?<br>
I like to be alone. It seems to be a strange answer, but I truly like to be alone because I can do whatever I want. I can enjoy playing computer games and watching movies without being disturbed by others when I am alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>I enjoy <strong><tagname style="color:red">spending some quality time with</tagname></strong> myself. As I am an <strong><tagname style="color:red">introvert</tagname></strong>, being quiet and alone allows me to <strong><tagname style="color:red">escape from dull daily routine and do nothing but play with</tagname></strong> my own unique and even weird thoughts.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When was the last time you were alone and what did you do then?<br>
Maybe last weekend. When I came back home, I found that my parents were out. So, I tidied up my room and turned on the TV to watch some TV programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Last Saturday, I locked myself in my room for a whole day. I <strong><tagname style="color:red">didn't get up until</tagname></strong> 9 o'clock <strong><tagname style="color:red">and then</tagname></strong> made an egg sausage sandwich for myself. After breakfast, I watched my favourite movie &quot;Flipped&quot; again and <strong><tagname style="color:red">lost myself in my sweet imagination</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What do you always do when you are alone?<br>
I usually watch movies when I am alone. Because I think it makes me feel comfortable to turn off all of lights in my room and watch a nice movie. That is the way life should be.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I <strong><tagname style="color:red">feel like socialising</tagname></strong>, I go out and have meals, go to the movie theatre and talk a lot with my besties. But when I like to <strong><tagname style="color:red">have some peace and quiet</tagname></strong>, I find a <strong><tagname style="color:red">less populated place</tagname></strong> like a small coffee house or my own room and stay quiet, read books and pray for a while.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>How do you usually spend your time by yourself?<br>
Like I said above, when I am home alone, I like to watch movies. But on a nice day, I also enjoy reading a book or exercising outside.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, thats <strong><tagname style="color:red">refreshing</tagname></strong> for me. But it can't last long because growing up as the only child in my family, I'm afraid of being alone for too long. I need to have someone to talk to and hang out with.</p>
<h2 id="laugh">Laugh</h2>
<ol>
<li>Are you the kind of person who makes people laugh?<br>
No, I am not the kind of person who can amuse others. I find it difficult to find common topics to communicate with others. But I like to keep company with this kind of person!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">Humorous as I am</tagname></strong>, I don' t always <strong><tagname style="color:red">feel at ease telling jokes in front of strangers</tagname></strong>. If they are not close to me, I often <strong><tagname style="color:red">a sense of insecurity</tagname></strong> and don' t know what to say. <strong><tagname style="color:red">Since</tagname></strong> I know little about you, I am afraid of saying something that might easily <strong><tagname style="color:red">offend</tagname></strong> you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you like to watch movies or TV shows that make people laugh?<br>
Yes, I do. Often at the end of a long day or a long week, I am in need of a lot of rest. So, I often relax by watching comedies which relieve my anxiety and tiredness.</li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer TV shows to movies. As we are living at a faster pace, <strong><tagname style="color:red">the pressure from study and work is on the rise at the same time</tagname></strong> and we are also losing quality leisure time, <strong><tagname style="color:red">I often find it incredibly hard to find a big chunk of time to be devoted to a more-than-one-hour movie.</tagname></strong> Therefore, I prefer to watch TV shows which are shorter but funny and relaxing.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you usually make your friends laugh?<br>
No, I am not the kind of person who can amuse others. Some people can find humor in everything and share it freely. I do not have an outgoing personality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, my friends often call me <strong><tagname style="color:red">the life of the party</tagname></strong>. I enjoy watching traditional Chinese cross-talks and stand-ups and am able to <strong><tagname style="color:red">do a good imitation</tagname></strong>. From these performances, I <strong><tagname style="color:red">have learned</tagname></strong> how to tell decent jokes <strong><tagname style="color:red">without hurting</tagname></strong> other people's feelings.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think it is important to laugh with friends?<br>
Yes, I think it is important. If you don’t laugh with your friends, they may consider you to be unsociable and aloof.</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, that's a thing I do with my best friends whenever we meet. From my perspective, <strong><tagname style="color:red">life is full of unexpected twists and turns</tagname></strong> and if we are not good at staying calm in times of failure, we <strong><tagname style="color:red">may lose the courage to carry on</tagname></strong>. It may sound like a difficult thing to do, but when you laugh with your friends, you will find that all of a sudden, everything is fine.</p>
<h2 id="water-sports">Water sports</h2>
<ol>
<li>Are water sports popular in China?<br>
No, I don’t think so. I think many people don’t have a chance to play water sports in their hometown. On one hand, water sports are expensive in cities where they are available, on the other hand, not all cities have water sports.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the rapid economic development in China, water sports <strong><tagname style="color:red">which used to be exclusive for the rich have become increasingly popular among ordinary Chinese people.</tagname></strong>. As summer comes, swimming in water parks or pools is a popular family activity.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you done any water sports?<br>
I have done some, but not many. When I travelled to Phuket Island, I played on a banana boat and snorkeled. They were really exciting and relaxing sports.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course. I have tried <strong><tagname style="color:red">a variety of water sports</tagname></strong> from swimming, surfing, wake-boarding, to canoeing. I have done canoeing individually and with a bunch of friends in the water park. It was relaxing and adventurous.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What water sports do you like doing?<br>
I like snorkeling, although I have not snorkeled many times. It is an easy way to explore the ocean and doesn’t require complex skills. All I need to do it is to wear the suit and snorkeling mask and use the breathing tube.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favourite water sport is diving while doing underwater photography. I love playing with water and photography, so it is <strong><tagname style="color:red">an ideal sport form</tagname></strong>, Diving in the deep blue water equipped with a camera always offers <strong><tagname style="color:red">exquisite</tagname></strong>, exciting, and <strong><tagname style="color:red">rare picture-perfect moments</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What kind of water sports do you want to try?<br>
I want to try deep diving. Because compared to snorkeling, deep diving would let me go deeper and see more sea creatures, such as turtles and crabs. However, deep diving requires certain skills, which take time to practice.</li>
</ol>
<p>I <strong><tagname style="color:red">have always been curious about</tagname></strong> the extreme sport cliff diving. I've seen people doing it multiple times on You Tube, It looks like <strong><tagname style="color:red">the least complicated</tagname></strong> extreme sport. There's no equipment to buy, no special clothing to wear and no provider services to hire It's just your body, <strong><tagname style="color:red">sailing through the air from dizzying heights and plunging into a body of water below</tagname></strong>. It sounds exciting and cool.</p>
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you like running?<br>
Yes, of course. Running is my favourite sport. I usually run 5 kilometers every day. It is a kind of aerobic exercise which can improve our cardiovascular health.</li>
</ol>
<p>Definitely Running can help us <strong><tagname style="color:red">burn calories quickly</tagname></strong> and keep our body parts work in a positive manner. Besides, it removes all the negative emotions and pressure from work and study. I even enjoy <strong><tagname style="color:red">a sound sleep</tagname></strong> after running for half an hour.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How often do you go for a run?<br>
Like I said earlier. I usually run for 5 kilometers every day. I like to go running first thing in the morning because I start the day feeling more relaxed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I went to college, I was super lazy and led a sedentary life. But since I became a college student, I become self-conscious that it is necessary to <strong><tagname style="color:red">keep me in a good shape</tagname></strong>. So I run every other day.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Where do you usually go running?<br>
I usually go to the university stadium to run. The stadium has a nice track and not many people use it in the morning. So, I usually go there.</li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer to run on the treadmill at the gym. Compared with running outdoors, this is <strong><tagname style="color:red">much healthier</tagname></strong>. <strong><tagname style="color:red">Due to</tagname></strong> the serious air pollution, running outside <strong><tagname style="color:red">is equal to</tagname></strong> ruining my lungs.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think running is a good way to stay healthy?<br>
It has been proven that running is a kind of aerobic exercise which can improve our cardiovascular health. I enjoy running very much and I think it is a good way to relieve stress.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="arts">Arts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Is there any artwork on the wall in your room?<br>
Yes, I have an oil painting on the wall in my room. It depicts a beautiful scenery of Fuji Mountain which I have been to before.</li>
</ol>
<p>Quite a lot. My father had a lot of friends working in the field of art like traditional Chinese papercutting, calligraphy, traditional Chinese brush paintings and sculpture. On holidays, we often receive artwork from his friends. These beautiful pieces will be hung on our wall in the living room.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you ever visited an art gallery?<br>
No. I haven’t. I am not good at art and don’t really have an interest in it, so I haven’t been to an art gallery before. But I like to listen to music. Thus, I have been to many concerts.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">I have lived in quite a few metropolises from</tagname></strong> Shanghai, London to Beijing, all cities with <strong><tagname style="color:red">incredibly diverse</tagname></strong> arts and cultures as well as art galleries. So I often visit an art gallery with my friends. <strong><tagname style="color:red">In most cases</tagname></strong>, we have no idea what the paintings at the exhibition are about but we  <strong><tagname style="color:red">had a lot of fun taking selfies with</tagname></strong> those mysterious paintings as our background.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like art?<br>
No, I don’t. Compared to art, I like music more because music has a power of healing. Whenever I feel tired or anxious, I like to listen to some relaxing music.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><tagname style="color:red">I am a diehard fan of art</tagname></strong>. When talking about art, it is <strong><tagname style="color:red">just natural</tagname></strong> to think of those big names like Van Gogh, Da Vinci, <strong><tagname style="color:red">or something like that</tagname></strong>. But I think art can be cute and simple as well. Pop art with striking colours and round shapes is my cup of tea.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Have you ever had art classes?<br>
Yes, I signed up for calligraphy class and painting class when I was in primary school. Every summer holiday, I enjoyed drawing natural scenery, big buildings and strip-cartoons with my crayon. My teacher often said I was talented.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cake">Cake</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you like eating cakes?<br>
Yes, of course I love eating cakes. Doesn’t everyone? My favourite is mixed fruit cake. But I don’t like to eat those cakes with lots of cream. I like the fruit and chocolate cakes more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, it depends. A super delicious cake <strong><tagname style="color:red">requires quality cream</tagname></strong>, soft bread and superb cake-making skills. And a cake like that is dear in most cases. <strong><tagname style="color:red">In contrast</tagname></strong>, a <strong><tagname style="color:red">more affordable</tagname></strong> cake tastes like <strong><tagname style="color:red">dust</tagname></strong> and sometimes even feet. So I like eating cakes when they are expensive.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you ever made cakes?<br>
No, I haven’t. I am not that kind of person who is good at baking things. So, I haven’t tried to make cakes and I don’t think I will make cakes in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am <strong><tagname style="color:red">a really bad cook</tagname></strong> whose most famous dishes are instant noodles and burnt toasts. <strong><tagname style="color:red">So as you may probably guess</tagname></strong>, I have never ever made cakes of any kinds. But luckily, all my friends are interested in making desserts and cakes. You can often find them wherever an oven is equipped.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What desserts do Chinese people like?<br>
I think many people like to eat sweets because they are cheap and easy to buy. Sweets come in many flavours and can satisfy many people's tastes.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of most Chinese meals, seasonal fresh fruit is often served as dessert. But Chinese cuisine also has a number of popular sweets, some of which are only made for special holiday period. Take for example Chinese almond cookies, nian gao  (a glutinous brown sugar cake), eight treasures rice pudding, etc.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you like dessert?<br>
Yes. My favourite food is mixed fruit cake and chocolate cake. Although they are a high sugar and fatty food, I still can't help craving dessert every day.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had a sweet tooth when I was a little girl. I was fond of whatever tastes sweet and contains a lot of sugar such as red velvet cakes, strawberry ice cream, marshmallows, lollipops and popsicles. But as come of age, I like dessert the least because my skin is sensitive to sugar and a bite of sweet food may well lead to a big red acne on my face. Thats disturbing. So I just reject all desserts.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<ol>
<li>Did you like history when you were young?<br>
I liked history, but I disliked the history class. I think history is the most boring subject that I have ever taken. There is no skill to learn it. All that you need to do is to remember, remember and remember.</li>
</ol>
<p>My answer is yes. I guess it is all because my father is a <strong><tagname style="color:red">voracious</tagname></strong> reader of history. When I was alone at home, I used to <strong><tagname style="color:red">pull out a thick book</tagname></strong> from my fathers tall and large bookshelf and <strong><tagname style="color:red">thumb through the pages with illustrations and cartoons</tagname></strong>. In most cases, the book in my hands was a history book.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When was the last time you read about history?<br>
I follow the topic of history in my Daily News App, so it will push me to read many interesting historical stories every day. It is very good App and I enjoy the history stories in it. The stories are brief, but I can get more information if I am interested.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I am an English major, I read British history voraciously back in college. **<tagname style="color:red">It all started by accident when I binge-watched</tagname>**the popular British TV series Downton Abbey. <strong><tagname style="color:red">The exquisite clothes, etiquette and decoration</tagname></strong> shown in the TV series <strong><tagname style="color:red">captured my full attention</tagname></strong>. So I read about the making of the Great Britain.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have you ever been to historical museum?<br>
Yes, I have been to many historical museums. The biggest one that I have been to is the Forbidden City. But I think the most interesting historical museum is the Xi’An Historical Museum because Xi 'An has a long history and many stories took place in Xi 'An. Many important people were born and lived there, as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>I <strong><tagname style="color:red">rarely</tagname></strong> go to museums of any type, but I visited a lot of historical museums when I was an exchange student in the United Kingdom. <strong><tagname style="color:red">To my surprise</tagname></strong>, there are historical museums in every city in the UK <strong><tagname style="color:red">that are open to the public without charge</tagname></strong>. I learned many historical facts about the Great Britain thanks to these museums.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you like history?<br>
Definitely. History was my favorite subject in senior high school. Unlike science which is all about calculus and formula, history tells us all kinds of interesting, exciting or tragic stories of humans past. I am all crazy about tales.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="science-class">Science class</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you think science classes are important?<br>
I think they are very important, especially for children. Science class can arouse students' curiosity and cultivate their ability to explore the unknown.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think science <strong><tagname style="color:red">plays an indispensable role in our society</tagname></strong>. It is now <strong><tagname style="color:red">the driving force in all aspects of our life</tagname></strong>, politics, culture and education. <strong><tagname style="color:red">Without</tagname></strong> science, it may have taken longer for us to go back to our hometowns since high-speed railway <strong><tagname style="color:red">would have not been possible</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Did you have science class in primary school or high school?<br>
Yes, I did have science classes in primary school. Science class was always full of fun because the teacher would tell us many interesting facts about the natural world. She always presented the information in an engaging way.</li>
</ol>
<p>I began to learn science in high school, <strong><tagname style="color:red">namely</tagname></strong> biology, chemistry and physics. I followed what my science teachers taught in junior high school. And thanks to that, I often came on top in all the examinations. But senior high school was <strong><tagname style="color:red">my nightmare</tagname></strong>, for the lessons taught in science classes <strong><tagname style="color:red">were unbelievably hard to comprehend</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like science class?<br>
Yes, I like it very much. Science class is always interesting because I enjoy thinking about science and nature. I think my primary school teacher encouraged me to want to learn more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not at all. I hated science classes more than any subject, especially physics. Thats all Greek to me. Maybe I have just conformed to the notorious stereotype that girls are good at arts whereas boys learn science faster. I never get full marks in any science class.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What kind of science did you do at school?<br>
Actually, I don’t remember exactly what I have learned in science classes in primary school, but I remember they were fun. In high school, I particularly enjoyed my science class in Biology.</li>
</ol>
<p>The science classes were <strong><tagname style="color:red">more interesting and interactive</tagname></strong> when I was in junior high Students could do science experiments in biology, physics and chemistry. But in senior high school, it was always exercises, study groups and papers.</p>
<h2 id="break">Break</h2>
<ol>
<li>How often do you take a break?<br>
I usually take a ten-minute break once every hour from whatever work I am doing. It is very essential for me so I can unwind and refocus on my task again.</li>
</ol>
<p>I take a break every month, because China has traditional festivals/holidays <strong><tagname style="color:red">every single month</tagname></strong> like Mid-autumn Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, etc. In most cases, it's short but refreshing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why do you need to take a break?<br>
I think people need to take a break to relax so that they can recharge and focus on their task at hand again. Otherwise, they may feel tired and run out of energy. In a way, taking breaks enhance people’s working efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the saying goes, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy. I believe it is unhealthy to spend all my time working. Work, study and leisure are all essential to our physical and mental health. <strong><tagname style="color:red">If well- balanced, the three could bring about greater effects</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What do you usually do during a break?<br>
I usually close my eyes to relax or l go out to breathe some fresh air. Sometimes, I will get myself a cup of tea or coffee.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since school days are busy, the first thing I do during a break is stay at home, <strong><tagname style="color:red">enjoy adequate sleep</tagname></strong>, and <strong><tagname style="color:red">binge-watch</tagname></strong> the entire 10 seasons of Friends. After a full rest, I may fly to a foreign country like Korea <strong><tagname style="color:red">with my besties and expose myself to a different culture</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you prefer long break or several short breaks?<br>
I prefer one long break than several short breaks. Because several short breaks can easily distract people from staying focused on one thing. With long breaks, I can concentrate on my task to avoid making mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, it's a tough decision for me. I like them both, but if I have to choose between the two, I prefer a long break. During a long vacation like winter or summer vacation, I feel free to try various things like traveling abroad with family or friends, start a big project or finish an internship.</p>
<h2 id="number">Number</h2>
<ol>
<li>Are you good at math?<br>
I think I am quite good at math. Math is my favourite subject and I spend a lot time studying it. Among all of the aspects of Math, I am very skillful at finding the solutions to geometric problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that there is <strong><tagname style="color:red">an Asian stereotype</tagname></strong> that Chinese students are all good at math. But to be honest, my favourite subject is English and I hate math, especially Calculus, since kindergarten. And it is because of math that I didn't choose science and technology as a major.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you usually use numbers?<br>
I usually use numbers in my day to day life. Everything we do in our lives normally requires a little bit of math and numbers. So, mathematics plays an important role in the real world and I think it is the one of the most useful subjects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not really. As an English major, I haven't used numbers since college, for English is one of a few majors that does not require the students to learn <strong><tagname style="color:red">advanced math</tagname></strong>. So numbers are Greek to me.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Are you good at remembering phone numbers?<br>
I have to say I am not good at remembering phone numbers. I only remember the phone numbers of my parents and my boyfriend. This is because I usually use WeChat to video call my friends, so there is no need for me to remember their phone numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not at all. I am bad at remembering <strong><tagname style="color:red">long sequence of numbers not logically arranged</tagname></strong>. As I <strong><tagname style="color:red">aspire</tagname></strong> to become an excellent interpreter, this becomes one of my major weaknesses. Because a person with good short-term memory can keep in mind more information and messages <strong><tagname style="color:red">within a limited period of time</tagname></strong>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What ‘s your favourite number?<br>
It must be 14. It was my student ID from my primary school to high school. It is very amazing that this was my number as my student for so many years, because the students IDs are usually given to students by the rank of their entrance exam scores.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favourite number is 100. One of the reasons why is because <strong><tagname style="color:red">it represents full marks and straight A academic excellence</tagname></strong>. Every time I get 100 points, I become <strong><tagname style="color:red">more eager</tagname></strong> to learn new things. The other reason is it always <strong><tagname style="color:red">reminds me of pure and perfect things without flaws</tagname></strong>. For example, if a beverage manufacturer uses the phrase 100% apple juice, it builds an honest and reliable image.</p>
<h2 id="park">Park</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer natural parks or amusement parks?<br>
I prefer natural parks. I love the feeling of peace and calm that I can find at a natural park. Though there are tons of fun things to do in an amusement park, I would be happier to take a walk in a forest or beside a lake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people like going to parks?<br>
There isn’t much open space in the city, all the buildings are close together and living spaces are tight. A park is a brilliant place to escape these things and it can help people unwind and relax.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, it was so, a decade ago. Because at that time, people preferred to chat with each other in person instead of on a smart phone. Therefore, <strong><tagname style="color:red">parks served as an ideal place to interact with friends</tagname></strong>. These days, the trend is to hang out in a shopping mall or movie theatre.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What activities can be done in a park?<br>
There are many activities that can be done in a park, such as playing badminton or football. But Chinese people especially like to do square dancing in the park. When the night falls, many retired people go to the parks, turn on the radio and start to square dance with the rhythm of music.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe a park is made for the purpose of family activities like flying kites with kids, going picnic, taking a walk with family members and walking a dog. And <strong><tagname style="color:red">it becomes a trend for</tagname></strong> young couples to go on a date in the park. They <strong><tagname style="color:red">stroll hand in hand</tagname></strong>, have sweet talks and smile to each other.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you often go to a park?<br>
Not very often. However, whenever I feel anxious or something bad happens, I will go to the park to unwind. A park is a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and the things that annoy me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not really often. With the rapid urbanisation in China, the city I live in <strong><tagname style="color:red">is losing green spaces</tagname></strong> like trees, arks and lawns. As I grew up in a city <strong><tagname style="color:red">full of skyscrapers</tagname></strong>, it is difficult for me to have fun in a park That's a real pity.</p>

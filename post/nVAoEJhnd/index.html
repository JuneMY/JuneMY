<h1 id="想和朋友探讨的电影">想和朋友探讨的电影</h1>
<p>Describe a film you would like to share with your friends<br>
You should say:<br>
Where you watched it<br>
What it was about<br>
Who you watched with<br>
**And why you want to share it with friends</p>
<p>I’ve been watching quite a lot of movies for the past month, since I had some free time on hand. Out of all the movies that I’ve watched, there was one movie that I couldn’t stop talking about, and I’ve shared it with many friends – it’s Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse.<br>
I saw the preview of the movie a few months before it was released. It was about how Spiderman saved the world with his friends. I asked one of my best friends, Michelle, to go watch it with me when it came out. We went to the closest cinema to our school and watched it on the premier day. After watching the movie, I found it very interesting to me. Whenever a friend asks me about a good movie, I would recommend this to her.<br>
In general, there are so many reasons why I suggest for my friends to watch this movie. Right off the bat, the animation in this film was incredible, especially when Spiderman was seen in recent years. Another one of the great things about this movie is that it conveys an idea of helpfulness and a sense of justice. Not only can the superhero save people in danger, but everyone in the world also has the power and obligation to help others when they are in need. Also, it is suited for all kinds of audiences. Kids will like it; adults will also enjoy it too. So, it is a good movie that is worth recommending to my friends.<br>
中文思路:<br>
自从有点空闲时间，上个月我看了很多电影。在所有看过的电影中，有一部让我爱不释手，我把它分享给了很多朋友——他是《蜘蛛侠:平行宇宙》。<br>
这部电影上映前几个月我看了预告片。这是关于蜘蛛侠和他的朋友拯救世界。我请我最好的朋友米歇尔 和我一起去看这部电影。我们去了离我们学校最近的电影院，在首映日看了这部电影。看完电影后，我 觉得这部电影非常吸引我，每当有朋友问起好看的电影，我都会推荐它 总的来说，我有很多理由推荐这部电影给我的朋友。它的动画效果令人难以置信，这是我近年来看过的 最好的科幻电影。这部电影的另一个伟大之处是它传达了一种帮助和正义感。超级英雄不仅能拯救处于 危险中的人们，而且世界上的每个人都有能力和义务在别人需要的时候帮助他们。而且，它适合各种各 样的观众。孩子们会喜欢它，成年人也会喜欢它。所以，这是一部值得与我的朋友分享的好电影。</p>
<h1 id="庆祝成就">庆祝成就</h1>
<p>Describe an occasion when you celebrated your achievement<br>
You should say:<br>
What you achieved<br>
How you celebrated it<br>
Who you celebrated it with<br>
And how you felt about it</p>
<p>While talking about an occasion for celebration, I was very impressed by the one that my parents celebrated for me after the college entrance examination.<br>
After I had studied very hard for a year, I was admitted to my favorite, Nanjing University, which is very famous in China. My parents were proud of me and held a celebration for my achievement. I invited my high school teachers and friends.<br>
We had a banquet at the best restaurant near my home. A bottle of champagne was always a good way to start an occasion with family and friends. We ate and drank together, cheering my success and sharing happiness with each other. Everyone congratulated me for being admitted to such a good university, and I felt extremely proud of myself at that moment. At the end of the banquet, we took pictures together because we would like to remember this wonderful moment with our high school teachers and friends. This was also the last chance for me to say goodbye to my high school time and to be ready for my university study.<br>
In general, when you put in a lot of effort and get the reward, you should feel proud. I really appreciate my parents and teachers. And I understand that their strictness with me was to make me better. To me, the banquet was not an occasion to celebrate my achievement, but it was the moment to look back and be thankful to everyone at the banquet who helped me in the past years.<br>
中文思路: 在谈到一个庆祝的场合时，我对我父母在高考后为我庆祝的时刻印象深刻。<br>
在我努力学习了一年之后，我被我喜欢的南京大学录取了，这所大学在中国非常有名。我的父母为我感到骄傲，并为我办了一场庆功宴。邀请了我的高中老师和同学。<br>
我们在我家附近最好的餐厅举行了一次宴会。与家人和朋友聚会时，喝瓶香槟总是一个很好的开始。我们一起吃喝，为我的成功欢呼，分享快乐。每个人都祝贺我被这样一所优秀的大学录取，那一刻我为自己感到无比自豪。在宴会的最后，我们一起拍照，因为我们想要记住与老师和朋友在一起的美妙时刻。这也是我告别高中时光的最后一次机会，并为大学生活做好准备。总的来说，当你付出了很多努力并得到了回报，你是值得骄傲的。我非常感激我的父母和老师。我明白他们对我的严厉是为了让我变得更好。对我来说，宴会不是庆祝我的成就，而是回顾过去，感谢宴会上<br>
的每一个人在过去几年里帮助我。</p>
<h1 id="读书写字的地方">读书写字的地方</h1>
<p>Describe a place where you read and write (not your home)<br>
You should say:<br>
Where it is<br>
How often you go there<br>
What it is like<br>
And explain how you feel about this place</p>
<p>When I think of my school classes and lessons, I feel a lot of stress. So, after school, I would like to find a quiet and peaceful place for me to study. A little park near my home is the perfect place for me to read and write because there are lots of trees and flowers in the park, but few people know about it.<br>
My home is in the suburb of Guangzhou, where I can enjoy that fresh air. So every day after school, I like to go directly to the park alone before going home. I make myself comfortable on a park bench and open my book. It feels like all of my stress leaves me as I start writing my homework on the stone table. At weekends, when I am reading alone, I would look up from my book to watch people as they walk by me. This makes me appreciate my afternoon even more because I can see different people than only the teachers and students at school.<br>
In general, this park is little, but the perfect place for me to have my own space and enjoy my freedom. In this way, I can escape from my parents’ supervision. The solitude of reading and writing alone in the park is very pleasant. In particular, sitting in the park, breathing the fresh air and smelling the green trees makes me feel calm and refreshed. I enjoy watching the colourful sunset while walking the long way around the park to go home.<br>
中文思路:<br>
当我想到我的学校课程，我感到压力很大。所以，放学后我想找一个安静的地方学习。我家附近的一个 小公园是我读书写字的好地方，因为公园里种了很多花草树木，而且很少人知道这地方。 我的家在广州郊区，在那里我可以享受到新鲜的空气。所以每天放学后，我想在回家之前直接一个人去 公园。我舒服地坐在公园的长椅上打开书。当我开始在石桌上写作业时，我感觉所有的压力都离开了我。 周末当我一个人看书的时候，我会从书中抬起头来，看着人们从我身边走过。这让我更加珍惜我的下午， 因为我可以看到不同的人，而不仅仅是学校的老师和学生。 总的来说，这个公园很小，但对我来说是一个拥有自己空间和享受自由的完美的地方。在这里我可以逃 避父母的监督。一个人在公园里读书写字的孤独是很令人愉快的。特别是坐在公园里，呼吸新鲜的空气， 闻一闻绿树，让我感到平静和神清气爽。我喜欢一边看五彩缤纷的日落，一边绕着公园走很长一段路回 家</p>
<h1 id="初见时刻">初见时刻</h1>
<p>Describe a time when you first met someone<br>
You should say:<br>
Where you met him or her<br>
When you met him or her<br>
What you talked about<br>
And how you felt about</p>
<p>I had quite a lot of friends when I was in high school, but Melody was the most interesting person I have ever met in my school.<br>
I first met Melody in art class which was the first lecture I took in university. It was a mandatory class (必修课), so not a lot of people were interested in it. And nobody seemed to be paying attention to the teacher.<br>
I first noticed Melody because she was really engrossed on taking notes on her notebook while listening to the teacher’s lecture. She drew my attention at that moment because I had never seen any classmates so focused on the art lecture like she was. So after class, I went up to her and started chatting with her. Through our conversation, I learned that Melody was really keen on game development, and she had always been dreaming of making her own game company someday. She listened to art class so carefully because she wanted to learn how to draw her own graphics in the game.<br>
She was really talkative about this subject, and told me a lot of game ideas and designs that she’s working on. I was fascinated by her unique and interesting ideas of game development, so we became very close friends. To be honest, her game ideas are really one of a kind, and I sincerely believe that her game will shine once it gets released.<br>
中文思路: 我在高中的时候有很多朋友。但是梅洛迪是我在学校里见过的最有趣的人。 我第一次遇见梅洛迪是在美术课上，那是我在大学的第一节课。这是一个选修课,所以并不是很多人都对 它感兴趣。而且似乎没有人注意到老师。<br>
我第一次注意到梅洛迪是因为她在听老师讲课的时候非常专注于在笔记本上涂鸦。那一刻，她引起了我 的注意，因为我从来没有见过像她这样专注于艺术讲座的同学。所以下课后，我走到她面前，开始和她 聊天。在我们的交谈中，我了解到 Melody 非常热衷于游戏开发，她一直梦想着有一天能创建自己的游 戏公司。她非常认真地听美术课，因为她想学习如何在游戏中画自己的图形。 她对这个话题非常健谈，并告诉我许多她正在研究的游戏理念和设计。我被她独特而有趣的游戏开发理念所吸引，所以我们成为了非常亲密的朋友。说实话，她的游戏理念真的是独一无二的，我真心相信她<br>
的游戏一经发布就会大放异彩。</p>

<p>Describe a time that you were sleepy but had to stay awake<br>
You should say:<br>
When it happened<br>
Why you were sleepy<br>
Why you had to stay awake<br>
And how you stayed awake?</p>
<p>When I think of my last year at high school, I still remember how hard I studied day and night for the College Entrance Exam.<br>
As well known, the Exam is very critical for each of our senior students in the secondary school. We started to prepare for it at least a year ago. Since we had classes during the day, I still often studied late every night till the early morning. Sometimes I could only sleep six hours a day, so I often felt sleepy.<br>
I could not forget the day before our last final exam, my physics teacher suddenly gave us a lot of homework. It was impossible to do the homework and review for the exam within a day, I knew I had to stay up late to finish them.<br>
In the evening, I had been reviewing until 1:00am. I was too sleepy to concentrate on the book. But I knew that I could not go to bed at that time if I wanted to do a good job in the exam. So, I made a cup of coffee to refresh myself. The effect of caffeine really made me feel much more alert. I cheered up and continued to review the book till three o'clock in the morning.<br>
In general, it's really hard for me to stay awake when I'm terribly tired because I used to sleep at least eight to nine hours a day. However, when it's necessary to devote myself to something important for my study and future career, I can stay awake even though I am very sleepy.<br>
中文思路: 当我想起我在高中的最后一年，我仍然记得我如何努力学习，为高考日日夜夜。 众所周知，考试对我们每一个高中生来说都是非常重要的。我们至少一年前就开始准备了。由于我们白 天上课，我经常学习到很晚，直到凌晨。有时一天只能睡六个小时，所以我经常感到困倦。 我不能忘记在我们最后一次期末考试的前一天，我的物理老师突然给了我们很多家庭作业。要在一天之内完成作业和复习考试是不可能的，我知道我必须熬夜完成它们。晚上，我一直复习到凌晨一点。我太困了，无法专心看书。但是我知道，如果我想在考试中取得好成绩， 我就不能在那个时候睡觉。所以我冲了一杯咖啡来提神。咖啡因的效果真的让我感到很兴奋。我振作起 来，继续复习这本书，直到凌晨三点。 一般来说，当我非常累的时候很难保持清醒，因为我过去每天至少要睡 8 到晚上。然而，当我需要为我 的学习和未来的事业投入一些重要的事情时，我可以保持清醒，虽然我很困。</p>

<p>When it comes to a toy that I liked in my childhood, I would like to talk about my toy cellphone. It is a gift which mother gave to me on Christmas Eve. Even though it was not so expensive or beautiful, it contained a lot of my memories of childhood and my parents’ love.<br>
My mother always told me the stories about Christmas when I was young, so I was a big fan of Santa Claus. Once she told me Santa Claus would come to our town and climb into our home from the chimney and he would leave me a gift beside the dinner table. So, I rushed to living room and surprisingly found that there was a cellphone on the table! The special gift I got from Santa was that toy cell phone. The moment I opened the gift box, I was so excited and jumped up high because it was a cell phone that I was longing for to have for a long time.<br>
I picked up the phone and said “Hi Santa!”. To my surprise, there was a male voice answered, “Ho Ho Ho...” I was overjoyed by hearing this voice and I never forgot it for so many years even though my belief in Santa dropped off the following year. After hearing this pleasant story my mom told me, I came to understand the “voice of Santa” was actually from my Dad. This was a toy cell phone with recording function. My father surprised me by recording the voice of Santa Claus in advance.<br>

<p>Normally during the summer vacation when school was finally over, I used to have tons of free time to hang out with my friends. However, this summer, all of them had packed schedules somehow. I ended up all alone without friends to have fun with.<br>
One day when I found an anime-themed café online, I decided to go there alone. However, when I arrived at the café, the waitress told me that all reservations were full, so I had to share one table with another girl who was also alone.<br>
As I sat down, I greeted the girl who was sitting across from me. Her name was Jenny, and she also came alone. I surprisingly found that she had a lot of similar hobbies as me, such as anime, novels, and movies. We commented on the café’s decoration and its food. We both enjoyed the same taste and kinds of foods. When we talked about the anime, both of us loved drawing anime characters whenever we were free. Besides we also loved to see the same movie “A Dog’s Journey” because both of us are fans of Henry Liu.<br>
It was a nice place for a cozy chat and a cup of coffee. And it was a very interesting conversation because it is hard to meet strangers that have so many similar interests as mine. Jenny was an interesting and humorous person to chat with because she made lots of funny references as she talked. Even after the coincidental encounter at the café, I’m still in contact with her to discuss our hobbies together.<br>

<p>When I was a child, my parents moved from Guangzhou to Shanghai because of their work requirements. I was seven years old when we moved to Shanghai, and I was enrolled into a public elementary school near our home. Shanghai Eastern Elementary School was located in Pudong Economic Zone. There were about 500 students and about 50 teachers in the school. Even now, I still remember it was surrounded by a little park and some apartments. The school concentrated much more on English learning than the other school nearby.<br>
At first, when I entered the school, I was a little timid, but my home room teacher (班主任) noticed me, and helped me merge in with the class. His name was Mike, and he taught us English. He was really nice and funny. He always took us to the school library to read and listen to some original English books. He was so eager to answer our questions all the time. To be honest, we were able to learn a lot of vocabulary and grammar from him. Mr. Mike used to tell us: if we wanted to learn something, we should have strong interest in it to motivate ourselves when learning.<br>
In addition, my class was friendly and teeming with positivity. This made me eager to study harder with my classmates. I learned that it’s really important to have positivity in your learning environment to gain motivation for studying. Nowadays, whenever I think of my nice teachers and diligent classmates, I miss my elementary school.<br>

当我还是个孩子的时候，我的父母因为工作的需要从广州搬到了上海。我七岁搬到上海时，我被附近的 一所公立小学录取了。上海东方小学位于浦东经济开发区。学校里大约有 500 名学生和 50 名教师。直到 现在，我仍然记得它被一个小公园和一些公寓包围着。这所学校比附近的其他学校更注重英语学习。<br>
起初,当我进入学校,我有点胆小,但我的班主任注意到我,并帮助我融入班集体。他名叫迈克，教授英语。 他真的很好很有趣。他总是带我们去学校图书馆读和听一些原版的英语书。他总是那么热切地想回答我 们的问题。说实话，我们从他那里学到了很多词汇和语法。迈克曾经告诉我们:如果我们想学习一些东西， 我们应该对它有强烈的兴趣来激励自己学习。 此外，我的班级很友好且积极向上。这使我渴望和同学一起更努力地学习。我明白了在你的学习环境中保持积极的态度来获得学习的动力是非常重要的。现在，每当我想起我的好老师和勤奋的同学，我就会想念我的小学。</p>

<p>It’s been a really long time since I’ve met with my friends from primary school. So, we wanted to plan a reunion and have dinner together last Friday at a Pizza Hut near our old primary school.<br>
At 6:00 pm, classmates arrived, and we took up four tables of space and had pizza together. However, I gradually found that we actually did not have much in common to talk about with each other. For example, most girls liked to chat about how handsome or how rich their boyfriends were. Boys were interested in discussing the computer games and NBA , etc. To me, I had no boyfriend and no interest in any computer games or basketball. So, I was getting bored soon and wanted to go home as early as possible. But in order to be polite, I could only try to look interested while I was listening to their conversation. Actually, I was bored stiff and even yawned once at the dinner table.<br>
Frankly speaking, I really had a very boring time that night. I thought the main reason was that I haven’t seen my friends for years, and we hadn’t updated each other with our new events and ideas in daily life. As we got older and older, we had less and less time to meet with each other. Then there are less and less common topics for us to chat about. In general, I was very disappointed with this reunion although I was so eager to see my friends at the very beginning.<br>

我已经很久没有见到我小学时的朋友了。所以上周五我们想要重聚，一起在老小学附近的必胜客吃晚饭。<br>
下午 6 点，同学们来了，我们占了四张桌子，一起吃披萨。然而，我逐渐发现，我们实际上并没有太多 的共同之处来谈论彼此。例如，大多数女孩喜欢谈论她们的男朋友有多帅或多有钱。男孩子们对讨论电 子游戏和篮球很感兴趣。对我来说，我没有男朋友，对任何游戏和篮球都不感兴趣。所以我很快就厌倦 了，想早点回家。但是为了表示我的礼貌，我只能在听他们谈话的时候尽量表现出感兴趣的样子。事实 上，我无聊得僵硬，甚至有一次在吃饭的时候打了个哈欠。<br>
坦白地说，那天晚上我真的很无聊。我认为主要的原因是我已经很多年没有见到我的朋友了，我们也没 有在日常生活中互相更新我们的新事件和想法。随着年龄的增长，我们见面的时间越来越少。然后我们 可以聊天的话题就会越来越少。总的来说，虽然一开始我很想见我的朋友，但是这次聚会让我很失望。</p>

It took us almost four hours to drive from Guangzhou to Mawei Island. Unfortunately, on the way it started to rain and we could not help but be concerned about the weather at the island. While we were driving along the road to the hill of the island, the rain stopped after a while and it became sunny again. Just then, I looked up and found the rainbow, a masterpiece of rain and the sun. It hung high in the sky like a colourful sky-bridge above the sea. From a distance, it was as thin as a ribbon. Seven colors shined brightly, bright but not dazzling. I stood on the top of the island and looked at the sea with blue sky and white cloud. The rainbow was like a band woven by flowers, which was hanging on the skirt of sky blue and floating with white clouds.<br>
The scene was delightful and beautiful! I could not stop taking a lot of pictures while watching the marvelous and fascinating sky. It solidified all the soft colors of the world in the sky. It seemed to bring us into a fairy tale world, brilliant and dazzling. We were fascinated by this beautiful sky and stayed until sunset. It was an unforgettable memory for my family in the recent years.<br>

Three months ago, I borrowed a wrist watch from my father. I was scheduled to take standardized tests for school and I wanted a watch so I would know the time.<br>
All of my friends and I check the time on our cell phones, but cell phones aren’t allowed in the examination rooms. Then I remembered that my father owned a nice watch, so I asked him. I wasn't sure he'd loan it to me because it's very expensive, but he didn't hesitate. On the day of the exam, he gave it to me and said, “I hope it brings you good luck! Take good care of it.” And I never took it off my wrist the whole day!<br>
These standardized tests are timed. I didn’t know if there would be a clock in the room that I could see from my seat. If I know the exactly time, I will be able to adjust my speed of answering the questions and set aside time to check my answers.<br>
The watch was very, very useful for me. Doing well on these tests is very important. I really appreciated that my father trusted me with his watch and I gave it back to him with my thanks. In fact, this watch gave me more confidence and courage from my father when I was taking the exams.<br>

It was soon the year where I had to decide which major I should choose for my university study. My father wanted me to study chemistry because he was a specialist in this field and he could arrange a good job for me in the future. I agreed to do so, but I was not sure whether I was interested in it. My mom was definitely the first one who noticed that I wasn’t really happy learning chemistry. One day after school, she told me that I shouldn’t just follow what they suggested for me to do. I was a little shocked and asked why she told me that. My mom explained that it was because she wanted me to find what I actually had interest in to pursue my future career.<br>
With my mom’s advice, I spent a whole week trying out different school clubs, experiencing different activities, and exploring new interests. I started to gain interest in learning visual arts. This was because of a visual artwork in a show. And I was mesmerized by the different messages and feelings it conveyed.<br>
So, I chose visual arts as my major in university. My mom’s advice gave me more confidence to choose what I was fascinated with. I realized that: the most important thing when choosing a major is interest because interest is one of the biggest motivators for one to work hard in your studies.<br>

Litchi is the fruit of the litchi tree, a tropical fruit that can only be grown in the south because it only grows in areas with high temperatures and humidity. Guangdong and Fujian are its main producing areas. Litchi looks red and is as small as a Ping-Pong ball.<br>
Regarding to why it’s popular, well, I guess the main reason probably lies in the taste, which is quite subtle, but at the same time, very distinctive. Litchi tastes very sweet, not sour at all, and tastes like jelly. If you’ve ever had it before, you’ll notice that the flavour kind of lingers in your mouth, especially its sweet taste. Litchi can not only be eaten directly, but also be made into preserved fruit and canned food. My mother even told me that it is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine, which can help sleep and promote digestion<br>

Yesterday when my mom looked at one of these photos, she burst into loud laughter. This picture was taken by her at Christmas Eve when I was seven years old. In the picture, I was standing between my parents and smiling in front of a Christmas tree with a piece of mail in hand.<br>
I had believed in Santa Claus since I was little. I thought Santa was a human being who could come to our house and climbed into our home from the chimney. I was going to send a letter to Santa to request a nice present. The letter was the one held in my hand in that picture.<br>
As I grew up, I came to understand that it was my parents who had pretended to be Santa Claus to give me presents at Christmas Eve every year. This touching photo they took when I was seven is one of the best pictures I like. What a heart-warming and memorable story is behind this precious photo!

Every night at eight o 'clock, there is a laser light show in Victoria Harbor. All the lights along the harbour are turned on. The buildings on both sides of the harbour are completely outlined into different shapes and colors by the lighting system. Besides, many different kinds of fireworks will be lit off in the high sky with the rhythm of music. All of this make the light show to be one of the most fascinating night scenes in the world. My grandpa was very excited to see such a light show and asked me to take many photos for him. I also took some wonderful photos of the night scene, which I shared with my friends and they all thought it was very beautiful.<br>

<p>About two years ago, I made a wooden bird for my mother as a birthday gift. My mother loves wooden handicraft, so I decided to make a special gift by myself.<br>
In our school, I’ve learned how to design some small pieces of handicrafts. Our teacher taught us many skills on how to deal with soft woods as well as hard woods. Moreover, along with stone, clay, and animal parts, wood was one of the first materials worked by early humans. Thus, it was not so difficult for me to make a wooden bird. After learning, I got to know that softwood was most commonly found in China and is lighter in weight. The lower density of softwoods allows it to have a great strength, and it is also more available and accessible. Therefore, finally, I decided to make the wooden bird of softwoods, and I did it in about half a month. It took me a long time to shape this wooden bird as I was not that kind of ingenious person. But I thought the effort was worthwhile because this wooden bird has a pointed mouth and a high tail that is very lifelike.<br>
It is really a memorable experience, because it was the first time that I made something by myself. Moreover, I also found that wooden handicraft making, along with other leisurely activities, could strengthen our body as well as our brain. Furthermore, making something by hand and then giving it as a gift really helps in social interaction. After making that wooden bird for my mother, I often invite my friends over to make wooden handicrafts together with me, and this is really an effective way to make friends.<br>

大约两年前，我曾经为妈妈做过一只木制的鸟作为生日礼物。我妈妈喜欢木制工艺品，所以我决定自己做一个特别的礼物。在我们学校，我学会了如何设计一些小工艺品。老师教了我们许多处理软木和硬木的技巧。此外，除了石头、粘土和动物的部分，木材是早期人类最早使用的材料之一。因此，对我来说，做一只木制的鸟并<br>
不难。通过学习，我了解到软木在中国最常见，而且重量更轻。较低的软件密度使其具有强大的强度，而且更容易获得。所以，最后，我决定用软木做一只木鸟，我用了大约半个月的时间。虽然我花了很长时间才制作了这只木鸟，因为我手脚都笨笨的。但我觉得这一切都是值得的，因为这只鸟嘴巴尖尖的，尾巴敲得很高，看上去栩栩如生。这真的是一次难忘的经历，因为这是我第一次自己做东西。此外，我还发现，木制工艺品，以及其他休闲活动，可以加强我们的身体和我们的大脑。此外，亲手制作东西，然后把它作为礼物送给别人，真的有助于社交活动。在为妈妈做了那只木鸟之后，我经常邀请我的朋友来和我一起制作木制工艺品，这真<br>
的是一种非常有效的交朋友的方式。</p>

<p>Describe an occasion that you didn’t tell a friend the truth<br>
You should say:<br>
When it was<br>
Where it happened<br>
Why you didn’t tell the truth?<br>
And explain how you felt about it</p>
<p>Whenever I think of Lucy, my best friend in high school, I feel terribly ashamed and regretful that I did not tell her the truth that I actually spent more time studying than she did every day.<br>
It is well-known that the College Entrance Exam is crucial for every student in the high schools. This caused some unnecessary competitions among classmates, including Lucy and I. We used to study and play together like twins at school. Both of us wanted to go to the same university and major in finance, which is a very popular major in today's China.<br>
I remember it was the Friday evening before the exam. Lucy wanted to go to the school library with me to study. But I told her that I have never studied on Friday evenings. In fact, I reviewed my textbooks every evening and studied harder than anyone else in my class. But I did not want to tell Lucy the truth when she invited me to the library with her. Eventually, I was admitted by our dream school, but Lucy, unfortunately, couldn’t make it happen.<br>
Nowadays, even though we are still best friends chatting online every day, I am always ashamed of myself that I lied to Lucy. Sometimes I ask myself whether I should tell her the truth when I meet her in person again. However, I don’t want to do so because I am afraid it will ruin our friendship forever. From this, I learn that we should have positive, not the negative competition between best friends. This will help both of us to maintain our friendship and grow together.<br>

每当我想起高中最好的朋友露西，我感到非常羞愧和遗憾，我没有告诉她的真相是我实际上每天比她花了更多的时间来学习。众所周知，高考对每一个高中生来说都是至关重要的。这导致了一些同学之间不必要的竞争，包括露西和我。我们曾经在学校像双胞胎一样一起学习和玩耍。我们都想去同一所大学学习金融专业，这在今天的中国是一个非常受欢迎的专业。我记得那是考试前的星期五晚上。露西想和我一起去学校图书馆学习。但是我告诉她我从来没有在星期五晚上学习过。事实上，我每天晚上都复习我的课本，比班上任何人都用功。但是当露西邀请我和她一起去图书馆时，我不想告诉她真相。最终，我被我们梦想中的学校录取了，但不幸的是，露西没能如愿<br>
以偿。如今，即使我们仍然是每天在网上聊天的好朋友，我总是为自己对露西说谎而感到羞愧。有时我问自己， 当我再次见到她时，是否应该告诉她真相。然而，我不想这样做，因为我担心这会永远毁掉我们的友谊。 从中，我学到我们之间应该是良心竞争关系，而不是最好的朋友之间的消极竞争。这将有助于我们双方 保持友谊，共同成长。</p>

You should say:<br>
What is it<br>
When you lost it<br>
How you found it<br>
And explain how you felt about it</p>
<p>Honestly. I am a careless person and often lose stuff especially when I am in a rush. Last summer, I lost my cell phone, but fortunately I found it in the end.<br>
It was a Saturday morning, and my sister and I were going to Hong Kong to go shopping. As soon as we arrived at the train station, my sister paid for the taxi fare, and then we ran to the boarding gate. All of the sudden, I realized my cell phone was not in my pocket when I reached for it to check the train information.<br>
The first possibility came up to my mind was that I might have left it in the taxi just now. My sister called the taxi company right away. We were informed that the taxi driver did not leave, but was waiting for us to pick up our phone. I burst into tears because I was so panicked when I realized I lost my cell phone. I was afraid that I had lost a lot of my lovely family pictures in it.<br>
Nowadays, cell phones become our necessity in our daily life. We use them like pocket-size computers for most of our activities. Losing a cell phone is like a disaster, especially when we are on a trip. I wanted to reward the driver, but he refused to accept it. He said that it was what he should do. There is a saying: The kindness from strangers is sometimes more touching. I felt relaxed and warm in my heart at that moment. This impressed me because my feelings were just like a roller coaster, from when I lost and then found my cell phone.<br>

事实上，我是个粗心大意的人，经常丢东西，尤其是当我很忙的时候。去年夏天，我的手机丢了，但幸运的是我最终又找回了它。那是一个星期六的早晨，我和姐姐要去香港购物。我们一到火车站，我姐姐就付了车费，然后我们就向进站口跑过去。突然，当我想查看火车信息时，我发现我的手机不在我的口袋里。我首先想到的可能性是我刚才可能把它落在出租车上了。我姐姐马上给出租车公司打了电话。我们被告 知出租车司机没有离开，而是在等我们找手机。我情不自禁哭了起来，因为当我意识到我的手机丢了时， 我非常惊慌。我担心我会丢失了手机里面我家庭很多照片。<br>
如今，手机成为我们日常生活中的必需品。我们在大多数时间里面都像使用袖珍电脑一样使用它们。失 去手机就像一场灾难，尤其是当我们在旅行的时候。我想报答司机，但他拒绝了。他说这是他应该做的。 俗话说:陌生人的善良有时更令人感动。那一刻，我感到内心的放松和温暖。这给我留下了深刻的印象， 因为我的感觉就像过山车一样，从我迷路的时候，然后找到我的手机。</p>

<p>Two years ago, I read in the community newspaper that a swimming pool complex would be built only five blocks from my home. Recently, it was completed and opened to the public. My friends and I were very curious about how it looks. We wanted to go for a visit.<br>
As expected, this swimming pool complex gives lessons in the main pool for adults and children. There are also competitive swim teams that practice in the pool. And, there is a diving pool that has three diving boards at different heights and people can take diving lessons there also.<br>
First of all, what I really like about the pool complex is that it has open hours when anyone can go in and use the facilities just for fun. My friends and I especially enjoy the diving area. I think having this great facility so close to my home is special and I consider myself very lucky. My friends and I swim and dive much more frequently because we don’t have to travel to the sea shore for swimming. It gives everyone a fun place to go, especially when we want to cool off in the summer.<br>
In addition, a lot of international swimming competitions are held in this pool complex and they are exciting for me and my neighborhood to watch. It’s become a meeting area for the whole neighborhood, young and old. It really builds a sense of community belonging for everyone who lives around it. It improves the quality of life for our neighborhood in the community.<br>

两年前，我在社区报纸上看到一个游泳场馆将建在离我家只有五个街区的地方。最近，它完工了并向公众开放。我和朋友们都很好奇它是什么样子。我们想去参观一下。不出所料，这个游泳场馆在主泳池为成人和儿童提供课程。还有一些竞争激烈的游泳队在游泳池里练习。 还有一个跳水池，有三个不同高度的跳板，人们可以在那里上跳水课。 首先，我真正喜欢游泳池的原因是它有开放时间，任何人都可以进去，只是为了好玩。我和我的朋友特别喜欢跳水区。我觉得有这样一个离我家这么近的设施很特别，我觉得自己很幸运。我和我的朋友们经常游泳和跳水，因为我们不必去海边游泳。它给每个人一个有趣的地方去，特别是当我们想在夏天凉快一些。此外，许多国际游泳比赛都在这个游泳池举行，我和我的邻居都非常兴奋可以观看比赛。它已经成为整个社区的聚会场所，无论老少。它确实为生活在它周围的每个人建立了一种社区归属感。它提高了我们社区居民的生活质量。</p>

I really enjoy family games at home with my parents and grandparents. Saturdays are usually our family days. We gather at our living room and play poker games after dinner.<br>
Poker is a competitive card game among several players. Most of the time, my grandparents would like to form a team; my father, my mother and I are the independent players. The table game we play the most is called Blackjack. The object of the game is to get the total value of your cards as close to 21 without going over. This is how the game is played out. Actually, we do not bet money among family members, the loser usually needs to wash dishes or do housework after dinner.<br>
Every Saturday evening, playing poker games together is an essential leisure activity in my family. My family has gathered for the family game since I was 16. It becomes a hobby for every family member. My grandparents had this idea because they wanted to maintain the cohesion of the family.<br>
To me, I enjoy playing with my parents because I like to share fun and happiness with each other during the game. We often chat and laugh together while we are playing. I think this harmonious environment is the necessary element I long for in a happy family. Playing indoor games with family on Saturday is very leisurely because we do not need to worry about weather, transportation, or food. I think it is a relaxed, healthy, warm and sweet way for the family to gather.<br>

我非常喜欢和我的父母和祖父母在家里玩家庭游戏。星期六通常是我们的家庭日。晚饭后，我们聚在客 厅里玩扑克。扑克是一种多人参与的竞争性纸牌游戏。大多数时候，我的祖父母组成一个团队，我的父 亲，我的母亲和我是独立的成员。我们玩得最多的游戏叫 21 点。这款游戏的目标是让你的卡牌的总值接 近 21，而不需要翻牌或爆牌。这就是游戏的玩法。其实我们在家庭成员之间是不赌钱的，输的人通常晚 饭后要洗碗或做家务。<br>
每个星期六晚上，在家一起打扑克是一项必不可少的休闲活动。从我 16 岁起，我的家人就聚在一起玩家 庭游戏。它成为了每个家庭成员的爱好。我的祖父母想出这个点子因为他们想保持家庭的凝聚力。对我 来说，我喜欢和我的父母一起玩，因为我想在游戏中分享彼此的乐趣和幸福。玩游戏时我们经常一起聊 天和笑。我认为这种和谐的环境是我渴望幸福家庭的必要因素。星期六和家人在室内玩游戏是非常悠闲 的，因为我们不需要担心天气，交通和食物。对我来说，这是一个轻松、健康、温暖、温馨的家庭聚会 形式。</p>

<p>My father has been working in a German chemical company for 20 years. I know that he works very hard every day. And he has been promoted from a sales person to a sales manager and is now the general director of the company in Asia.<br>
When I was little, I had already noticed that my father always needed to travel for his job. He would take airplanes from South to North China, and from East to West Worldwide. He devoted himself to his job completely, especially when he was promoted to the general director in charge of the Asian market. He loves this new challenge as he keeps telling me all the time. Nowadays he travels much more than before. The cities he often flies to include: Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Soul, New Dehli, and Singapore etc.<br>
Compared with the high speed rail, airplane is a fastest mode of transportation for people to take between two cities that are far apart. Since my father is so busy with his job, I can see he walks faster than people around him. He never wastes his time on insipid things. He always sets goals, one after another, and works hard to achieve them.<br>
In general, my father enjoys doing his job for his company. He always tells me he works hard because he would like my mom to be relaxed at home taking care of me. In addition, when he travels to different cities and different countries, he likes to meet different people, see different cultures and purchase gifts for me and my mom. All of these are the motivation for my father to work hard every day.<br>

我父亲在一家德国化学公司工作了 20 年。我知道他每天都努力工作。他从一个销售人员晋升为销售经理， 现在是该公司亚洲地区的总经理。当我还小的时候，我就已经注意到我父亲总是出差。坐飞机从中国的 南边到北边，从东方到西方。特别是当他作为亚洲市场的总经理时，全身心地投入到工作中。他一直告 诉我喜欢这个新挑战。现在他比以前出差的更多。他经常飞往的城市包括:北京、上海、东京、首尔、新 德里和新加坡等。与高速铁路相比，飞机是人们在两个遥远城市之间最快的交通工具。由于我父亲工作 太忙，我可以看到他走得比周围的人都快。他从不把时间浪费在无聊的事情上。他总是一个接一个地设 定目标，并努力实现它们。总的来说，我父亲喜欢为他的公司工作。他总是告诉我他工作很努力，因为 他想让妈妈在家放松地照顾我。此外，当他去不同的城市和国家出差时，他喜欢认识不同的人，看到不 同的文化，给我和我的妈妈买礼物。所有这些都是我父亲每天努力工作的动力。</p>

<p>Recently, the happiest thing was that our school gave us a day off for the school anniversary celebration. That’s to say, I got a whole day that I didn’t have to study or work, I could relax a bit. My best friend Lucy called me and asked me if I wanted to try skiing. I said yes. So, we decided to go to the Four Seasons Ski Resort together.<br>
This is an indoor ski resort that is open all year round. I felt very fresh and excited, because I had never seen snow in summer days. We put on thick ski clothes which made us looked stupid and cumbersome. We looked at each other and couldn't help but laugh.<br>
When I really started skiing, I found I couldn't keep my balance and fell down many times. It was also the first time for Lucy to ski, but she was obviously better than I. While I was still learning how to keep my balance and move slowly, she was already sliding slowly down the slope. I was depressed because on the way to the ski resort, I thought skiing would be so easy to learn. But the truth was, I could hardly go for more than a few meters. At this time, Lucy came up to encourage me and explained the skiing skills. Then I did as she said and practiced for a while. Eventually, I could ski for a while and it filled me with joy.<br>
It was really fun to play with my good friends and utterly relax without any pressure. I hope to try a bigger outdoor ski resort in winter.<br>

近期最开心的事，莫过于学校校庆给我们放了一天的假。这意味着我拥有了完整的一天，不要工作或者 学习。可以好好的放松和享受自由。我最好的朋友 lucy 打电话给我，问我要不要去尝试一下滑雪。我表 示很感兴趣。我们决定一起去四季滑雪场玩。<br>
这是一个室内的滑雪场，一年四季都开放。我感到非常新鲜和兴奋，因为我从来没有在夏天见过雪。我 们换上了厚厚的滑雪服，夏天穿成这样实在是很滑稽，我们忍不住哈哈大笑起来。<br>
当我真正开始滑雪时，我发现我无法保持平衡，没走出几米就摔倒了。Lucy 虽然也是第一次滑雪，但显 然他比我有天分的多。当我还在学习如何缓慢前进保持平衡的时候，他已经可以从坡上慢慢的滑下来了。 他看到我很沮丧，过来鼓励我，并且告诉我一些滑雪技巧。我练习了一阵，果然可以慢慢滑动了，我开 心极了。我们一直玩到晚上才回家。和我的好朋友一起，没有压力完全放松的玩耍，真的感觉很快乐， 我希望在冬天的时候能去更大的室外滑雪场试试。</p>

They will invite the hottest singers or actors to the stage. The show lasts for two to three hours and they will perform songs and dances or play games with the host.<br>
This summer vacation, my good friend Lucy and I travelled to Hunan. We found the discount ticket of the Happy Camp in Taobao.com by chance and we immediately bought two tickets! The show is recorded in the broadcasting building of Hunan Television Station. To our surprise, there was a sea of people outside the building. Lucy and I almost got lost! There were so many people that we only had one bar on our cell phones. Finally, we managed to get into the stadium and sit down.<br>
As soon as the host, HeJiong, stepped on the stage, the entire audience got excited! We shouted his name so loud that we could hardly hear each other. The famous actors Denglun and Lixian were guests. They played many different kinds of games with hosts and Lixian even performed dubbing!<br>

The program is recorded in the broadcasting building of Hunan Television Station. When we went into the recording venue, we were told that due to the need for program confidentiality, we were not allowed to bring mobile phones, cameras, or other photographic equipment to watch the program.

We waited for almost an hour for the recording to start. During this period, we were very bored because we had nothing to do.

I think it is a bit strict to restrict the audience from carrying their mobile phones and I wish they would change this rule in the future.<br>

<p>It's annoying to have your plans changed, but sometimes you have to change them. This summer vacation, my family and I planned to travel to Bangkok. This was the first time for my whole family to travel together this year. I had prepared for it for a long time, and I was full of expectations.<br>
We wanted to go to the airport by metro since it was the most convenient and fastest way to get to the airport. But when got to the metro station, I got a SMS which informed us that our flight had been cancelled for some unknown reason. We were confused because it was only three hours before the plane was scheduled take off. My mom said it was possibly fake information. But to be prepared for any contingency, I made a call to the flight company. Surprisingly, they told me they were very sorry that our flight was cancelled indeed and they would offer us some alternative flight to change to later, but it wouldn’t be today. Though we were very angry about that, we had no choice but to go back home and wait for further information.<br>
On the way home, my mom kept saying that this message was so important that if we didn't see it, we would probably have waited for hours at the airport and then come back for nothing. Now it only took ten minutes to walk to the subway station. But it was still an unpleasant thing to be delayed on our journey.<br>

计划被改变是一件很懊恼的事情，但有时候不得不改变计划。今年暑假我们全家计划去泰国曼谷旅行，这 是全家人今年第一次一起旅行，为此我准备了很长时间，内心充满了期待。<br>
我们打算乘地铁去机场，这是最快最便捷的方式。就在刚出发的时候，我的手机响了。我收到了一条短信， 短信显示我们的航班由于无法得知的外部因素被取消了。我感到很诧异，毕竟现在距离起飞只有三个小时。 我开始怀疑这是骗子，于是致电航空公司询问情况，结果是我们的航班确实被取消了。我感到非常生气， 我们一家人只能折返回家。<br>
回家路上妈妈一直说这条信息实在太重要了，如果没有看到信息，我们很可能在机场无聊的等待好几个小 时，最后再无功而返。而现在只是花了十分钟走到地铁站而已。但旅程被延误还是一件令人不愉快的事情。</p>

<h1 id="困难的挑战共同完成的项目">困难的挑战&amp;共同完成的项目</h1>
<p>This year, as a member of the student union of our college, I organized a singing competition at our college with several classmates from our student union department. It was the first time I've been involved in planning an event. At first, I was very nervous and didn't know what I could do in the team. But the minister of our department, Michael, had experience in organizing competitions, and he told us in detail how to organize it. Under his leadership, we divided the labor fairly. I was responsible for the designs of posters and application forms.<br>
At first, I didn't think it would be difficult. But the minister was not satisfied with my design and told me I had to use Photoshop to design a poster. This meant that I had to master how to use this software in a short time. It was such a huge challenge and I felt very anxious. I downloaded a lot of instructional videos and even stayed up late studying it. Our minister also taught me some skills and shortcuts on how to use Photoshop, which were very helpful. With his help, I mastered some basic operations and made some good posters.<br>
I learned a lot during this experience. It is very useful to master more practical skills. Also, when encountering difficulties, we should calm down and try our best to find the solutions.<br>
中文思路:<br>
几个月前，作为校学生会的一员，我学生会的其他同学一起策划了一场校园歌手大赛。这是我第一次参加 筹划全校范围内的大型活动，我很紧张，不知道自己在团队中能做些什么。<br>
我们部长有丰富的活动经验，他向大家详细说明了策划活动的步骤和要求，并且作出了详细的分工，其中 我负责宣传海报和报名表的设计。<br>
一开始我认为这很简单。但是部长对我做得图并不满意，告诉我必须用专业的 photoshop 软件才可以。这 意味着我必须在短时间内学会这个软件的基本使用。我感到非常焦虑，感觉这是一个巨大的挑战。我下载 了很多教学视频，甚至在熬夜学习。部长还亲自教我一些有用的 ps 的使用技巧和经验。在她的帮助下，我 已经掌握一些基本操作了，而且也做出了一些非常不错的海报。<br>
从这件事情上我学到了很多，多学习一些实用技能，总有一天会用得到。遇到困难的时候，我们需要静下 心来尽我们所能地解决问题。</p>

Our minister also taught me some skills and shortcuts on how to use Photoshop which were very helpful. With his help, I mastered some basic operations and made some good posters. I found that Photoshop is a very useful and practical software. We can use it to design posters or retouch some pictures.<br>
I learned a lot during this experience. It is very useful to master more practical skills. Sometimes things are not as difficult as you think, as long as you learn and practice using it. Since I have learned to use Photoshop, my friends often praise my photos which I have retouched and posted on social media.<br>

一开始我认为这很简单，毕竟现在可以作图的软件很多。但是部长对我做得图并不满意，告诉我必须用专 业的 photoshop 软件才可以。这意味着我必须在短时间内学会这个软件的基本使用。我下载了很多教学视 频，并在宿舍内自学 PS，甚至熬夜学习。部长还亲自教我一些有用的 ps 的使用技巧和经验。在她的帮助 下，我已经掌握一些基本操作了，而且也做出了一些非常不错的海报。<br>
PS 绝对是一个非常实用的软件，不仅可以制作海报，平时旅行拍的一些照片也可以进行美化。专业的作图 软件果然和平时用的手机软件大不一样，做出来的海报非常专业。<br>
从这件事情上我明白了多学习一些实用技能，总有一天会用得到。有些东西并没有想象中那么难，只要多 看多练习其实很容易。自从我学会了用 photoshop，朋友圈的图片经常被朋友赞美。我感到很骄傲</p>

<p>The family member I spent most time with is definitely my sister. She is 5 years older than I and I have known her since I was born. I think she is the one who could understand and know my thoughts most in my family because my parents and I can never get along peacefully due to the age barrier.<br>
When we were young, we played together, cursed each other, but cared about each other too. Whenever there were students who bullied me, she would always stand by me. We share happiness, overcome difficulties together and cherish the affection between us.<br>
As we grew up, dad and mom were usually busy working. It was my sister who cared me more than my parents. She not only helped me with my homework, but also helped me cultivate many good habits. She likes to read different kinds of books from novels to literature. So, I began to read books in a very early age. She taught me that reading can open our minds and broaden our horizons. So, I am always very good at Chinese lessons. She never brings out the facts and reasons to teach me, but influences me with her words and deeds. She has taught me many things that have benefited me all of my life. I love and thank her very much.<br>
中文思路:<br>
平时在家里，陪伴我最多的人就是我的姐姐，她比我大五岁，我从一出生起就认识她了。很多时候，由于 年龄的差距，我觉得和父母无法沟通，只有姐姐才能真正的理解我。小的时候我们一起打打闹闹，嘴上咒 骂着对方，心里却关心惦记着彼此。只要有同学欺负我，我回家找姐姐诉苦，他总是气的要找别人算账。 在我们的成长中，有彼此的陪伴，慰藉，从来不会感到孤单。<br>
后来我们逐渐长大，父母的工作也越来越忙碌。比起妈妈，都是姐姐照顾我更多。姐姐不仅在生活上照顾 我，辅导我的作业。更是言传身教，让我养成了很多好习惯。姐姐非常喜欢读书，她有空的时候从不看无 聊的电视剧，会阅读各种类型的书籍。所以我从小就跟着姐姐一起看书，从小时候的故事书看到现在的文 学历史。姐姐在不知不觉中教会我读书可以使人开阔视野。从小到大，我的语文成绩一直在班里名列前茅。 她从不给我讲道理，而是用自己的一言一行影响着我。他教给我的很多东西都让我受益一生，我非常爱她 和感谢她。</p>

<p>About a couple of weeks ago, I broke my cell phone accidentally. But my mum promised to buy me a new one since I had used the broken cell phone for about two years and I got good scores on the final exams. I eventually bought a Huawei mate 30. As soon as I got it, I was fascinated by its beautiful appearance. The aurora-colored shell glowed with enchantment. Moreover, it has a very good photo shooting function since it had a Leica camera. I was very excited at first. But when I got home, I began to study the instructions. I found that Huawei's operating system was completely different from iPhone, and almost all the operations had to be re-adapted. I spent the whole night studying the instructions and searching online, and then understood its basic operations.<br>
Then I tried to import the data from the original iPhone into the new phone. At this time, I found it very difficult. Except for the address book and a few apps, the original photos, notepad and most of the apps had to be downloaded again. This series of problems made me feel that this mobile phone was too difficult to use. It took me almost two weeks to get used to it. I thought if I had the chance, I absolutely would have bought the latest iPhone instead.<br>
中文思路: 大概几周前，我原来的手机摔碎了，因为它已经使用了两年时间，加上这次期末考试我的成绩还不错，妈 妈答应给我买一部新手机。我想来想去，最后买了一部华为 mate30 手机。 刚拿到手，我就被它美丽的外观迷倒了。极光色的外壳闪着迷人的光芒。加上莱卡的摄像头，特别是拍照 功能实在是太强大了。一开始我高兴极了。回家后我开始翻看说明书，发现华为的操作系统和苹果完全不一样，几乎所有的操作都要重新适应，我用 了一整晚时间，不停的翻看说明书和上网查找方法，才明白了它的基本使用。 接着我尝试把原先 iphone 里的资料导入新手机，这时候我发现非常困难，除了通讯录和个别 app 可以传入 新手机，原先的照片，记事本和大部分的 app 都要重新下载。这一系列的问题让我觉得这部手机实在是太 难用了。我几乎用了两周时间在逐渐适应它的操作。如果再给我一次机会，我会买一部最新款的 iPhone.</p>

<p>In our daily life, we may help others or be helped by others. We will lead a happier and more harmonious life because of others’ help. During my summer vacation this year, I had a part-time job at a café and recognized a new friend, Lucy.<br>
She comes from England and she is a nice girl. She came here to study for a master degree, but she was not good in Chinese. So, whenever we got off from work or whenever I was free, I would teach her some useful methods to learn Chinese. I also introduced her to other Chinese friends and took her to our school’s activities. I could notice that she improved her Chinese skills day by day and I was very glad about that. Lucy has been learning Chinese for half a year, and she can communicate with others in Chinese fluently. Last time we went to KTV, she could even sing a Chinese song. During this period, I learned how to get along with others. I felt that I had done the right thing. It is good to help others and it is also important to be a kind person. I helped her for no other reason than I thought it was the right thing to do.<br>
中文思路: 在我们的生活中，我们被帮助或得到别人的帮助，因为帮助，我们可以生活得更快乐。暑假的时候我在咖 啡馆做兼职，认识了好朋友 lucy。 她是一位英国的留学生，刚刚来到中国。她的汉语不好，但我很擅长。所以每当我们下班，或者我有空的 时候，我就会教她一些有用的学习方法来学习汉语。我还介绍了别的中国朋友给她认识，带她去参加我们 的聚会。我能感觉到她的中文能力逐渐在提高，对此感到很欣慰。直到现在，lucy 学习汉语半年时间了， 她已经可以正常交流，上次我们一起去 ktv，她甚至唱了一首中文歌。 在这个过程中，我学会了如何与他人相处融洽。在我看来，帮助别人不仅是快乐的自己，也让我们学会分 享。在这个过程中，我还认识了更多朋友，扩大了自己的交际圈。我认为这是一个快乐的过程。</p>

<p>Describe a uniform you wore when you were a student or at work<br>
You should say:<br>
When and where you had to wear this<br>
How it looks like<br>
Why you had to wear this<br>
And explain how you feel about wearing it</p>
<p>When I was in college, I rarely wore a uniform. I only wore it for important school events. So, I want to talk about school uniforms which I wore before.<br>
My high school gave us two types of school uniforms, one was for the winter, the other was for the summer. The summer school uniform was a light green T-shirt with shorts, while the winter school uniform was dark green trousers with a black cotton coat. At that time, we were required to wear uniforms at school. That meant I had to wear it every day.<br>
I think the reason why the school required us wear the uniform is that the school uniform is a kind of a status symbol, just like people of different professions need to wear different uniforms in society. For example, policemen, firemen, doctors and soldiers all have their own special clothes. Similarly, students naturally wear their school uniforms. When we put on our school uniforms, it is easier to recognize that we are students.<br>
As for me, I like wearing school uniforms very much. Uniforms can create a sense of equality. Because the family financial background varies from person to person, many people are outdoing each other to see who has a bigger house and who has a better car. If we wear the same clothes, not only students feel equal to each other, but also it is easier to create a spirit of cooperation, unity, and mutual respect.<br>
中文思路:<br>
上大学之后我很少穿校服，只有在学校重要活动的时候才会穿。所以我想谈谈之前的校服。 我高中的校服分为冬季和夏季。夏季的校服是浅绿色的 T 恤和短裤，而冬天的校服是深绿色长裤和一件黑 色的棉大衣。那时候学校要求我们在学校必须穿着校服。也就是除了周末不上课的时间，我每天都得穿着 它。 我想学校让我们穿校服，主要是一种身份的象征。就像社会上不同职业的人需要穿着不同的制服一样。例 如警察，消防员，医生，军人都有自己特定的衣服。同样的，学生自然要穿他们的校服。我们穿上校服时， 就更容易辨认出我们是学生了。<br>
对于我而言，我很喜欢穿校服。校服可以产生一种平等感。因为现在学生的家庭收入状况很不一样，学生 之间攀比严重，比拼双方家底。而大家穿着一样的服装，不仅同学相互之间感觉还平等的，而且更容易行 程一种合作团结，相互尊重的精神。</p>

<p>Last month, my friend and I were planning a party in the park. She and I were both going to invite ten friends and we were going to have a barbecue. The ten friends soon turned into twenty, but we didn't care, we thought we'd have a plenty of open space and it would be just fine. We were going to have a barbecue, play music and play volleyball because there was a volleyball court in the park. Unfortunately, the night before the party, we were listening to the weather report and it said we were going to have thunderstorms during the afternoon of the party. Obviously, we didn't want to have the party during thunderstorms. I suggested we cancel it and reschedule it at a later date. My friend disagreed because she had friends that were leaving town and if we changed the date, then they would not be able to come. So we thought about it and we decided to have the party at my house rather than the park.<br>
I'll be honest, it was a little crowded and we didn't have barbecue; we had sandwiches and hors d'oeuvres that we made, but everybody seemed to have a good time. We played music and we played some board games instead of volleyball. Although it different from the party we had originally planned, I think it was a good party and I felt happy that everyone enjoyed it.<br>
中文思路:<br>
上个月，我和我的朋友计划在公园里举行一个聚会。她和我都打算邀请 10 个朋友，我们打算去烧烤。10 个朋友很快就变成了 20 个，但我们不在乎，我们想我们有足够的空地，一切都会好起来的。我们打算去 烧烤，演奏音乐和打排球，因为公园里有一个排球场。不幸的是，聚会的前一天晚上，我们正在听天气预 报，天气预报说下午有雷雨。很明显，我们不想在雷暴的时候开派对。我建议我们取消它，改天再定。我 的朋友不同意，因为她有朋友要离开这个城市，如果我们改变日期，他们就不能来了。所以我们考虑了一 下，决定在我家举行聚会，而不是在公园。<br>
说实话，那里有点拥挤，我们也没有烧烤;我们做了三明治和开胃小菜，但每个人似乎都玩得很开心。我 们玩音乐，玩一些棋盘游戏而不是排球。虽然它不同于我们最初计划的聚会，我认为这是一个很好的聚会， 我很高兴大家都喜欢它。</p>

<h1 id="未来不想做的工作">未来不想做的工作</h1>
<p>My aunt and uncle own a car dealership and they seem to be the richest people in our family. Their company is located downtown, which is surrounded by a lot of auto shops. But I really don't like this kind of sales job. I know about the business because whenever we go to visit them, going to the car dealership is always a place that we have to stay. They sell new cars, but they also sell used cars. Some people will bring in their existing car and trade it in for a new car. They are always very busy and very involved in the business. If we want to visit with them, we often need to wait for them while they are finishing up some business, so they can do some sightseeing with us.<br>
I was always told by my father that I was not to do the same work as my uncle in the future because his working hours were not fixed, and he was always late for every family party. To a salesman, the customer is everything. As long as they call you, you need to fulfill their needs no matter how important the things are that you are doing, which is unacceptable to me.<br>
I think the reason why they are so successful and rich is that they are lucky and work harder than others. They often need to travel around the country or to go with clients to attend various dinners. In my opinion, they are already very good, but my uncle and aunt are not satisfied with that. They also attend business training courses to learn more knowledge and perhaps open another branch when the time is right. So only diligent and energetic people are suitable for similar jobs, but I am afraid I am not.<br>

我的阿姨和叔叔有一家汽车经销店，他们两个是我们家族最富有的人，他们的公司位于市区的汽车城，那 周围有很多汽车相关的店铺。但我非常不喜欢类似的工作，比如销售。我了解这个行业，因为每次我们去 拜访他们，汽车经销店总是一个我们必须呆的地方。他们卖新车，但也卖二手车。他们也有一个服务部门， 用来修理他们销售的汽车。他们总是很忙，非常投入的工作，如果我们想要去拜访他，有时我们需要等他 们完成一些业务，以便他们可以和我们一起观光。<br>
每次和他们吃完饭，我总会告诉爸爸将来一定不要做和叔叔同样工作，因为他的工作时间不固定，每次聚 会他总会迟到。对于一个销售来说，客户就是上帝。只要有客户有需求，不论有多重要的事都必须延后。 这对我来说是不能接受的。<br>
我认为他们之所以会很成功和很富有，除了运气好，还比别人付出了更多的时间。他们经常需要到全国各 地出差，又或者为了争取客户参加各种饭局。在我看来他们已经很厉害了，但是叔叔婶婶并不满足，他们 还参加了商业培训课程，想要学习更多知识，在时机成熟的时候再开一家分店。所以只有勤奋且精力充沛 的人才适合做类似的工作。</p>

<p>Recently, my friend Kathy and I decided to take a trip into Boston to see an old friend. Boston is about one and a half hours away by car. But we decided since neither of us knew the city well enough to drive in, or more importantly to park in because parking is a really big problem in Boston, we decided to take public transportation instead. We took the bus about halfway and then we had to transfer to a train that took us to the center of the shopping district.<br>
Travel time was scheduled to be about 3 hours. I was anxious about if we’d make the connection to the train in time, but there were no problems. The train was there when we arrived, so we didn't even have to wait. The bus and train were both very clean, comfortable, and fortunately, not very crowded. Time passed really, really quickly. Kathy and I were laughing and joking most of the way. The girl sitting next to me was kind and shared many snacks with us. The strangers we met on the train were kind and polite, and the atmosphere on the trip was great.<br>
When we arrived, we found that our old friend Olivia was in the station waiting for us. After a nice lunch that we ate outside and five hours of running from store to store, I was very glad that we chose to take public transportation home rather than to drive. Public transportation is economical and environmentally friendly, and we spent much less than driving. What’s more, we were both very, very tired and it was nice to be able to close our eyes and rest knowing that the train or the bus was taking us where we needed to go.<br>
中文思路:(可以把波士顿改为自己家乡周边的城市)<br>
最近，我和我的朋友凯茜决定去波士顿见一个老朋友。波士顿是大约两个半小时的车程，因为我们都不知 道开车去波士顿是否方便，因为停车在波士顿是一个大问题，我们决定乘坐公共交通工具。我们先乘大巴， 然后我们再转火车。<br>
行程时间约为 4 小时。我担心我们是否能及时赶上火车，但事实上没问题。我们到的时候火车已经停在站 里，我们不必等车。大巴和火车都非常干净，舒适。一路上凯茜和我都在闲聊和开玩笑，坐在隔壁的女孩 还分享了很多零食给我。车上遇到的陌生人都善良又礼貌，这趟旅途的气氛真是好极了。<br>
当我们到达了车站的时候，Olivia 已经在站里面等我们了。吃了一顿午饭后，我们三个在街上逛了五个小 时商店，并且买了很多东西，我很高兴，我们选择乘坐公共交通工具而不是开车回家。公共交通经济又环 保，这趟旅行的路费大约是我们自己开车的五分之一，而且因为我们知道火车或公共汽车把我们带回家， 所以疲惫的我们都闭上眼睛休息了。</p>

<p>An animal that I find interesting is a squirrel. When I traveled to the United States a few years ago, I saw many different kinds of squirrels which I had never seen in China. We could see them everywhere in America. They come in many different varieties and different colors.<br>
There was a big garden behind our hotel. They were always in the garden playing and they would be running around and looking for nuts. It was something that was very common for me to see, but I enjoyed watching them. I think they are fast, dexterous with their hands, intelligent and mischievous little animals. They live in trees and, especially in the fall, they look for acorns. They'll bury them and they'll be digging them up in the spring for food. The squirrels were in the trees, sometimes they would take these acorns in their hands and would throw them at us. They clearly didn't want us anywhere near their tree, even though it was our tree in our driveway, but they were funny. It was interesting to see them do this with their hands. I always thought that only humans and chimpanzees could use tools, but here we saw squirrels that were using their acorns as weapons. I just find them funny. I just think they are a very happy animal to watch.<br>
This experience was very unforgettable for me. The ecological environment in America is very good, so lovely wild animals can be seen everywhere. I think we should protect our environment so that I can see more lovely animals.<br>
中文思路:<br>
我发现一种有趣的动物是松鼠。几年前我去美国旅游的时候，我见到了很多不同种类的松鼠，在中国我从 来没有见过，它们都可爱极了。在北美，松鼠随处可见。它们有许多不同的品种。它们有不同的颜色。<br>
我们的酒店有一个大大的庭院，他们总是在我们的院子里玩耍，他们会跑来跑去，寻找坚果，这对我来说 很罕见，所以我很喜欢看他们。我认为他们是快速，灵巧的手，聪明和淘气的小动物。它们生活在树上， 秋天的时候会寻找橡子，然后埋起来，春天的时候再挖出来找吃的。松鼠在树上，它们会用橡子当武器。 他们会把它们拿在手里扔向我。他们显然不希望我们靠近他们的树，即使那是我们车道上的树，但他们很 有趣。看到他们用手做这个真的很有趣。我一直认为只有人类和黑猩猩才会使用工具，但这里我们看到松 鼠用橡子当武器。我只是觉得它们很有趣。我只是发现它们只是一种非常快乐的动物。这次经历让我非常 难忘，美国的生态环境非常好，所以随处可见可爱的野生动物，我想我必须要更加爱护生态环境，这样才 能见到更多可爱的小动物。</p>

And explain why you want to live there</p>
<p>My ideal house would be near the ocean. I would want it to be small, like a cottage, because I wouldn’t want to use a lot of effort to keep a large house clean. The house would have big windows to let in the sunshine and the ocean could be seen from every room. I want a large living room so the family would be comfortable sitting together. Most importantly, it would have a large porch or deck so everyone could enjoy being outside.<br>
I want to live with my family, including my parents, grandparents and our dog. This house would have to be a second home because I will probably need to live in the city to be near my workplace. So, I would probably only be able to go to my ideal ocean home on weekends and on vacations.<br>
An ocean home would be ideal for me because I have always loved being at the beach. I always feel refreshed and relaxed after a walk near the water. I love all of the sights, sounds, and smells near the open ocean. Then, when I have a family of my own, my children would grow up learning about the marine life and appreciating the environment. I could have my parents and friends to the house and we could sit on the deck and enjoy the sunrise every morning as we sip our morning tea. Hopefully, everyone would enjoy being near the ocean and would visit often!<br>
中文思路:<br>
我理想的房子应该在海边。我想要小一点的，像一间小屋，因为我不想花太多的精力来保持一个大房子的 清洁。房子有个大窗户让阳光照进来，每个房间都能看到大海。我想要一个大客厅，这样全家人坐在一起 会很舒服。最重要的是，它将有一个大门廊或露台，这样每个人都可以享受户外生活。<br>
我想和我的家人住在一起，包括我的父母，祖父母以及我们家的狗狗。这栋房子必须是我的第二个家，因 为我可能需要住在城市里，才能离工作地点近一些。所以，我可能只能在周末和假期去我理想中的海洋之 家。<br>
靠近海的家对我来说是最理想的，因为我一直喜欢呆在海滩上。在海边散步之后，我总是感到神清气爽， 精神放松。我喜欢大海附近的所有景色、声音和气味。然后，当我有了自己的家庭，我的孩子长大后，会 学习海洋生物和欣赏环境。我可以让我的父母和朋友来家里，我们可以坐在甲板上享受日出，每天早上我 们喝早茶。希望每个人都喜欢在海边，并且经常来游玩!</p>

This area used to be a street market, which was not only messy but also dirty. There was a row of garbage cans in backdoor of the market, which smelled terrible on hot days. But after years of planning and construction, it has become a modern swimming pool. Every summer, my father and I used to drive 30 minutes to another stadium to swim and play badminton. But now, it only takes me 10 minutes walk to go to the new stadium which is very convenient for me.<br>
As you would expect, this swimming pool complex gives lessons in the main pool for adults and children. There are also competitive swim teams that practice in the pool. And there is a diving pool that has three diving boards at different heights and people can take diving lessons there also.<br>
In addition, this is the newest and largest swimming pool in our city and there will be an important race here next month. That will be exciting for me and my neighborhood to watch. It’s become a meeting area for the whole neighborhood, young and old. It really builds a sense of community belonging for everyone who lives around it. Our community is getting more and more convenient and prosperous, which I am very proud of.<br>

离我家五个街区远的地方，不久前建设了一座新的游泳馆。它大约在一个月前前完工，我觉得它改善了周 围居民的生活质量。<br>
这片区域以前是一个菜市场，里面不仅乱还很脏，市场后门还有一排垃圾桶，天气热的时候难闻极了。而 经过规划和几年的建设，这里已经变成了一所现代化的游泳馆。以前每到夏天，我和爸爸都需要开车 30 分钟到市体育馆去游泳，而现在我只需要步行十分钟就能到达。我感到方便极了。<br>
正如你所预料的，这个游泳馆的主游泳池为成人和儿童提供课程。还有一些有竞争力的游泳队在游泳池里 练习。它还有一个跳水池，它有三个不同高度的跳板，人们可以在那里学习跳水课程。<br>
此外，因为这里是目前我们城市最新最大的游泳馆，下个月将有一场重要比赛在这里举行。这对我和我的 邻居来说都是非常激动人心的。它已经成为整个社区的聚会场所，无论老少。它确实为周围的每个人建立 了一种社区归属感。我的社区正在越来越方便，越来越繁华，对此我非常的骄傲。</p>
<p>某人给我道歉的经历<br>
Describe a time when someone apologized to you<br>
You should say:<br>
When and where this happened<br>
Who the person was<br>
Why he or she apologized<br>
And explain how you felt about his or her apology</p>
<p>One time someone apologized to me was last November. Every November 11th, there is a huge festival called &quot;Double eleven&quot; when all online businesses, such as Tmall and JD, will have large-scale discount activities. I bought a lot of things that day, including a red dress. This is a dress that I am planning to wear when I go to Thailand for my winter vacation. I think it is beautiful to take photos in, so I was very excited to get it. But everything else arrived in a week except for my dress.<br>
I made a call to the delivery company to ask where my package had gone. They said they would deal with it and call me back later. Soon after, I received a call from the courier. He was very embarrassed to tell me that my delivery had been lost during the delivery process. He tried to find it, but failed. He felt very sorry and was willing to pay me for cost of the dress.<br>
The reason he apologized to me was that he thought he made a mistake which caused a loss to others. He had to pay me for another dress or he would have been fined by his company. To be honest, even after he apologized, I was still a little angry because I had to reorder the dress and wait a long time. But after that, I got over it because I think everyone has done something wrong. A little more tolerance towards others may be also promote a spirit of kindness and virtue.<br>
中文思路:<br>
一次别人向我道歉的经历发生在去年十一月份的时候。在每年十一月中国有都一个类似黑五的节日叫做双 十一，那一天所有的网络商家比如天猫，京东都会有大规模的打折活动。<br>
那天我买了很多东西，其中包括一条红色的连衣裙。这是我准备寒假去泰国旅游穿的，我觉得穿着它拍照 一定非常好看。我很焦急的等待快递的到来，可是一周过去了，其他东西都收到了，只有我的裙子还杳无 音讯。我向卖家打听裙子的下落，结果不久后，我接到了快递小哥打来的电话，他很不好意思的告诉我， 我的快递在派件过程中不小心弄丢了，他已经找了两天了，但并没有找到。他感到非常抱歉，希望我能谅 解。他愿意把那条裙子的钱赔偿给我。<br>
他向我道歉的原因是他在工作中的失误给别人造成了损失。他不仅要赔偿我一条裙子，而且还会被公司罚 款。老实讲，即使他道歉后我还是有点生气，因为我还需要重新下单，并且再等待很长一段时间。但是之 后，我就不计较了，我觉得每个人都有做错事的时候，对别人多一点宽容，也是一种善良和美德。</p>

<p>Describe a goal you set that you tried your best to achieve<br>
You should say:<br>
What it was<br>
When you set it<br>
What you did to achieve it And how you felt about it</p>
<p>There's a competition in my local city that I've taken part in before. It's called the English Excellence Award - or EEA, and it's a competition that anyone in the city can take part in, as long as you have a passion for English.<br>
I know about this competition because our teachers tell us about it in school - it's actually quite a famous competition among students in the city. As soon as I heard the news, I set a goal to join it and win the prize because the first three competitors would be rewarded a seven-day trip to Beijing!<br>
The competition’s format is quite straightforward; around a month before the competition begins, the organisers will release three potential topics for the students to use within the competition. All I would need to do is to choose one of the three topics and prepare my own speech. I tried my best to prepare for it. I looked up all kinds of materials, wrote the speech, and then asked my English teacher to help me revise. Then I practiced my speech in front of the mirror, from the pronunciation and intonation to the movements and expressions. I wanted to do my best.<br>
Finally, all of my effort paid off. I took the third place in the competition! Although I did not place first, I still am very happy because I earned a free trip to Beijing!<br>

我所在的城市有一项赛事我曾经参加过，它被称为英语优秀奖，或者 EEA，这个城市里的任何人都可以参 加这个比赛。我们的老师在学校里告诉我们这个比赛的消息——实际上这是一个非常著名的比赛，在这个 城市的学生中。听到的时候我就决定要参加了，因为前三名可以获得免费的北京七日游!<br>
比赛的形式很简单;每年演讲的主题都会有所变化，在比赛开始前两个月左右，组织者会发布三个可能的主 题供学生在比赛中使用。我所需要做的就是从这三个主题中选择一个，准备我自己的演讲。我开始认真准 备这场比赛。查询各种资料，写演讲稿，然后找我的英语老师帮我进行修改。之后对着镜子练习演讲，从 语音语调，到动作表情，我都希望做到最好。<br>
最后，我所有的努力都得到了回报。我拿到了第三名!虽然我没能拿到第一，但是我还是非常开心!因为 我还是获得了免费的北京七日游!</p>
<h1 id="想见的一个新闻人物">想见的一个新闻人物</h1>
<p>Describe a person you saw in the news who you really want to meet<br>
You should say:<br>
How you know about this person<br>
Why you want to meet this person<br>
When and where do you want to meet him or her<br>
And explain how you might feel after meeting the person</p>
<p>I'd like to talk about a man who has been in the news recently. He has just given awards to all rural teachers in China, and I'd love to meet him. He is Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.<br>
He is so famous in China that I believe every Chinese person must know about him. The reason why I want to meet him is that not only is he a successful enterpriser but also, he has greatly changed our country. He established a public service organization called “Ants Forest” which has planted thousands of trees in the deserts of China. He also established a charity fund called “Country teachers” which has donated millions to build schools and dormitories in remote and undeveloped areas.<br>
I don’t care when and where I could meet him. This is not the point. If I do get to see him, I want to ask him the reason why he donates so much of his property for charity. And, what has happened to him to make up his mind to do this? As we know, many entrepreneurs only want to make money and some of them even do harmful things to society in order to make more money, such as the development of online games, and not to donate money to charity.<br>
If I have the chance to meet him, I think it would have a big impact on my life. In short, I think I could learn a lot from him. In the process, I could also emulate him to some extent and become a person who changes the world.<br>
中文思路:<br>
我想要谈谈最近出现在新闻里的一个人，最近他刚刚为中国所有的乡村教师颁了奖，我很想见到他。他就 是阿里巴巴的创始人马云。<br>
他在中国很有名，我相信每个中国人都应该知道他。我想见他的原因是他不仅是一位成功的企业家，而且 他也使我们的国家发生了巨大的变化。他建立了一个公益组织。这项名为“蚁林”的服务在中国的沙漠中 种植了成千上万棵树。他还建立了一个名为“乡村教师”的慈善基金，为偏远落后地区修建学校或宿舍捐 赠了数百万美元。<br>
我不在乎何时何地能见到他。这不是重点。如果我能见到他，我想问问他为什么要把很多财产捐给慈善机 构，或者他是怎么决定做这件事的。我们知道，许多企业家只想赚钱，他们中的一些人甚至做一些对社会 有害的事情来赚更多的钱，比如开发网络游戏，而不是把钱捐给慈善机构。<br>
如果我真的能见到他的话，我想对我的生活会有很大的影响。简单的说，我认为我能从他身上学到很多东 西。在这个过程中，我也能从某种程度上效仿他，成为一个改变世界的人。</p>
<p>健康文章<br>
Describe an article you read from the internet about healthy lifestyles<br>
You should say:<br>
When and where was it posted<br>
What the article was about<br>
How useful the information was<br>
And explain how you feel about the article</p>
<p>Last week, I read an article from the website medicinetoday.net that was posted last year. The article was called “Healthy Tips for Healthy Living”. It was basically a long list of small changes that people could make in their lifestyle and eating habits that would help them be healthier. It included sections on both physical and mental health.<br>
Since the article was written fairly recently, I thought it would have some new ideas that were supported by scientific research. The article started by saying that physical health and mental health needed to function together for a healthy lifestyle. Since this is something I totally agree with, I quickly became excited to read it. However, once I started, I began to lose interest. It included many short tips for people to consider, like to stop smoking, avoid fried foods, exercise more frequently, and develop good sleep habits. The article did reference scientific research that supported these suggestions, but I felt much of the information was common knowledge that everyone would already know. Some more examples of this are to stop smoking, and not to drink alcohol and drive.<br>
However overall, I think it was a good article to read and I am pleased that I read it. It did review some of the things that I know are important for a healthy lifestyle, for instance, to avoid sugary foods, walk more, and avoid excessive sun exposure, all of which I need to be aware of! I am happy to review things that will help me live a healthier lifestyle!<br>
中文思路:<br>
上周，我读了一篇去年发表在 medicinetoday.net 网站上的文章。这篇文章被称为“健康生活小贴士”。它基 本上是一长串的小改变，人们可以改变他们的生活方式和饮食习惯，以帮助他们更健康。它包括生理和心 理健康的部分。<br>
由于这篇文章是最近写的，我认为它会有一些新的想法，并得到科学研究的支持。这篇文章一开始就说， 身体健康和心理健康需要共同作用，才能形成健康的生活方式。因为这是我完全同意的观点，我很快就被 吸引了。然而，一旦我继续读下去，我开始失去兴趣。文章包括了许多可供人们考虑的小建议，比如戒烟、 避免油炸食品、更频繁地锻炼、养成良好的睡眠习惯。这篇文章确实引用了支持这些建议的科学研究，但 我觉得很多信息都是大家都知道的常识。更多的例子是戒烟，不喝酒和开车。<br>
然而，总的来说，我认为这是一篇值得一读的好文章，我很高兴我读了它。它确实回顾了一些我知道对健 康生活方式很重要的事情，例如，避免含糖食物，多走路，避免过多的阳光照射，所有这些我都需要注意! 我很高兴回顾那些能帮助我过上更健康生活方式的事情!</p>

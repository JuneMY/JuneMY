<h1 id="work-or-study常考题">Work or Study(常考题)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Why did you choose that subject?<br>
I am majoring in International Business. I chose my major subject of study based on my aptitude in studying economics, accounting, and languages, my interest in travel, and advice from my parents and teachers. I felt this major area of study would prepare me for a career that I would find interesting and that I could be successful in.</li>
<li>Is it interesting?<br>
I truly enjoy my courses because they are so interesting. There are a few courses that are more difficult for me than others, but I find if I put more time and effort into studying, I am able do well in them.</li>
<li>What subjects are you studying?<br>
This year, I’m taking advanced classes in Finance, Macroeconomics, English, and Information Technology. I am also taking a class in Modern European History because I thought this would be interesting.</li>
<li>Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoon?<br>
I prefer to study in the afternoon. I feel more alert in the afternoon than I do in the morning or the evening. I seem to be able to read, and comprehend more, in less time.</li>
<li>Are you looking forward to working?<br>
I am definitely looking forward to using the things I have learned in school in my career. I’m also looking forward to making money to support myself.</li>
<li>Do you like your subject?<br>
I love my subject because it is so interesting. I find the more I learn, the more I find interesting about it! I think everything I am learning will be useful in my career.</li>
<li>What work do you do?<br>
I recently started as a research assistant at a large international advertising firm. It’s an entry level position where I find statistics about the likes and dislikes of different age groups in a specific country that our client is looking to do business in.</li>
<li>Why did you choose to do that type of work?<br>
While this is not the final job that I was hoping for, it is a solid entry-level position in a firm that does the kind of work I am interested in. I enjoy gathering the statistics knowing that they will be used to make important decisions in marketing our client’s product. I feel there is a lot of room for promotion here in this company as well.</li>
<li>Do you miss being a student?<br>
I didn’t think that I would, but I do.As much as I like my job and I am grateful to have it, it is a big change. I am meeting new people and learning new responsibilities; my daily schedule is very different, but I need to expect a period of adjustment.</li>
<li>Do you like your job?<br>
I really enjoy my job. I think the work is interesting and look forward to learning more. I like all of the people I work with. There are two other research assistants who were hired the same time I was and I enjoy working with them.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="home-your-accommodation常考题">Home (Your accommodation)(常考题)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Can you describe the place where you live?<br>
I live in a high rise apartment building on the 5th floor overlooking the street with apartment buildings on either side. We have a balcony where we keep many of our plants and sometimes we’ll sit there in the evening.</li>
<li>How long have you live there?<br>
I have lived there for 18 years. I was born there.</li>
<li>Who do you live with?<br>
I live with my parents, my sister, and my dog. Sometimes my grandparents or aunt will visit us and they stay with us in our home.</li>
<li>Do you plan to live there for a long time?<br>
I’m hoping after I finish my education, I find a job and I can find my own home. Housing is expensive, so I may be home with my parents longer than I plan to be.</li>
<li>What is the difference between where you are living now and where you have lived in the past?<br>
I haven’t lived anywhere else. I have always lived here. My parents lived in a smaller apartment in a building nearby before I was born, but they moved here because they needed more room.</li>
<li>Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?<br>
I prefer living in a flat because it is so much more convenient, and neighbours seem much more friendly. Perhaps I like it because this is what I am accustomed to.</li>
<li>In the future, what type of place would you like to live in?<br>
I would like to live in a flat on the very top floor of a building. I think it would be quieter and we wouldn’t be able hear as much street noise and the view, especially at night, would be spectacular.</li>
<li>What kind of neighbourhood /environment/surroundings/home would you like to live in?<br>
I like living in the city where I am. I like the convenience of being very close to public transportation so I can go where ever I need to go. I like my neighbourhood because we have a variety of young people and old people. It’s our own community.</li>
<li>What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?<br>
We eat, sleep, and basically live together there. When we are all at home, we sometimes do things together, like watching sports on TV, other times we will go to our room to study or listen to music.</li>
<li>Which room does your family spend most of the time in?<br>
We spend most of our time in the living room. We will watch TV there or play games while lying on the floor. It’s the sunniest room in the house, so it is very pleasant to be in.</li>
<li>What part of your home do you like the most?<br>
I like my bedroom the most in my home. I have it decorated to my taste and feel safe and calm whenever I go into it.</li>
<li>Are the transport facilities to your home very good?<br>
Absolutely, that’s one of the reasons I like our neighbourhood. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the bus stop and from there, I can get anywhere in the city.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="3-hometown常考题">3. Hometown(常考题)</h1>
<p>1.What’s (the name of) your hometown?<br>
I live in Guangzhou. It is located in the Guangdong Province. and is known as the City of Flowers.<br>
2.Is that a big city or a small place?<br>
It is the third largest city in China. It has a population of over 13 million people. It’s a big place.<br>
3.Please describe your hometown a little.<br>
It is the educational and cultural centre of Southern China. It’s also known as the City of Flowers because there are evergreens and flowers in bloom year round because of its climate. It’s a pretty city.<br>
4. How long have you lived there?<br>
I have lived here all of my life, for eighteen years. My parents have lived here all of their lives too.<br>
5. Do you like it?<br>
I like it very much. Of course, this is all I have ever known, but whenever my family travels anywhere, I am<br>
always happiest when I return home.<br>
6.Do you like living there?<br>
I like living here because my family is here, my grandparents and aunt live here too. I like the climate because it never gets really cold. I don’t really like all of the rain we get in the summer, but even then, the rain keeps the air cleaner.<br>
7.What do you like (the most) about your hometown?<br>
I really like the food. The Cantonese food is excellent and there are so many other kinds of international restaurants to try. I also really enjoy Thai food.<br>
8.Is there anything you dislike about it?<br>
The humidity gets things damp in the house, so we have to use air conditioning a lot of the time. I don’t really like air conditioning, but we don’t have a choice but to use it.<br>
9. Do you think you will continue living there for a long time? / 10. Do you plan to continue living there? ( Combined two similar questions as one)<br>
I want to go abroad to study after I graduate from high school. I want to see what other cities and countries have to offer and then I’ll decide.</p>
<h1 id="the-area-you-live-in常考题">The area you live in(常考题)</h1>
<p>1.Do you like the area that you live in?<br>
I love the area that I live in. I am so lucky that we have so much to do which are very close to us! Also, there is public transportation just one block from my building. Everything is so convenient!<br>
2.What are some changes in the area recently?<br>
Over the past few years, some new restaurants have opened nearby which make eating out more convenient for everyone in the area. Also, last year, improvements were made to the park near my house. Some older trees were trimmed and some new varieties of trees were planted.<br>
3.Do you know any famous people in your area?<br>
Well, I really don’t think any famous people live near me. I have never heard of or met any famous person in my neighbourhood. I guess it’s because the area I am living in is an area for middle income families, not for famous people who have much higher salaries.<br>
4.Where do you like to go in that area?<br>
Like I said earlier, there are some new restaurants in the area. They are family-style restaurants, so they are the great places to go with my family for relaxed meals. Also, the park has always been a pleasant place to go. Everything I need or want is within walking distance to my home.</p>
<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<ol>
<li>When do you listen to music?<br>
I listen to music whenever I can. I enjoy listening to music when I'm on public transportation, going to and from school. I also like to listen to music sometimes when I'm studying. It helps to block out things in the background so I'm able to focus better.</li>
<li>How much time do you spend listening to music every day?<br>
I hadn't really thought about this until this question. I think I spend about 2 to 3 hours a day. I listen to it on public transportation and then when I study, but not all the time when I study. Sometimes it's distracting when I'm studying, but I would say 2 to 3 hours a day is a fair estimate.</li>
<li>What kinds of music do you like to listen to?<br>
I really enjoy K-pop, the energy and the lyrics, it’s just so lively and makes me feel good. I also like to listen to slower songs that have a deeper story like a ballad or something- a lot of fun to listen to a ballad. I also like to listen to instrumental music where there are no words, I sometimes find that to be very soothing when I'm trying to study</li>
<li>What’s your favourite kind of music?<br>
Without question my favourite music is K-pop. You can't listen to it without enjoying it. It's lively and it makes you feel good and when you're listening to it you're tapping your foot and just getting ready to be excited for the rest of your day. It just always puts me in a good mood.</li>
<li>Have you ever been to a concert before?<br>
Sadly, I have not been to a concert, but I'd like to go to one soon. Concerts are expensive but I'm saving up money and I have a few concerts that I have that in mind that I'd like to go to.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="tea-and-coffee">Tea and coffee</h1>
<p>1.Do Chinese people like to drink tea or coffee?<br>
I think more Chinese people prefer to drink tea than coffee. I know my family does. There are so many more flavours of tea that people can enjoy, and that’s why it is more popular.<br>
2.Do you prepare tea or coffee for the guests at home?<br>
I prepare and serve tea for guests at home. My mother will make coffee for the few guests who prefer coffee, because I don’t know how to make it properly.<br>
3.When was the last time you drank tea or coffee?<br>
I drank some green tea this morning. I have tea every morning. When I get home from school, I will often have an herbal tea. I have only tried coffee once, and frankly, I just don’t like it. It tastes very bitter to me.</p>
<h1 id="patience">Patience</h1>
<p>1.Were you patient when you were young?<br>
No, I was not patient at all when I was young. I remember having trouble waiting for meals and interrupting my parents for attention when they were busy. I cried and shouted when I was impatient and could not be quiet at all.<br>
2.How do you feel when other people are not patient?<br>
When younger children are impatient, it doesn’t bother me because I understand they are still learning. However, I get upset when older children and adults aren’t patient. It’s important to be respectful of other people.<br>
3.Were you less or more patience when you are angry?<br>
I am more patient when I am angry. This is because I always walk away until I am calmer. Then, I won’t do or say things that I may regret later. Walking away forces me to be calmer, so then I will be more patient.</p>
<h1 id="public-holiday">Public holiday</h1>
<p>1.How many public holidays do you have in China?<br>
There are seven public holidays we can enjoy in China. If it’s counted by days, there are 11 public holidays each year. For some of the Chinese, they can enjoy one or half a day for their own holiday. For example, Chinese women enjoy half a day on Women’s Day.<br>
2.Do you think people need more public holidays?<br>
In my opinion, I think people need more public holidays in China. With more and more work and study burden, Chinese people have less time to enjoy their own hobbies or to attend their family activities nowadays. In addition, more holidays can encourage people to travel more.<br>
3.How do you usually spend your holidays?<br>
Usually I spend my holidays with my family or my friends. I often gather with family at a restaurant for a morning tea or a meal. Sometimes I will go to the cinema with my good friends for a movie. If I have more holidays, I would rather travel with my family or friends.<br>
4.Which holiday is your favourite?<br>
My favourite holiday, without a doubt, is the Spring Festival which is our Chinese New Year. This is a traditional Chinese festival and it’s the most important holidays for Chinese families. Normally, no matter where we are, we go home to meet our parents and grandparents during these days in a year.</p>
<h1 id="outdoor">Outdoor</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do you prefer to be indoors or outdoors?<br>
Personally, I prefer being outdoors rather than indoors. It feels great to go outside and exercise a bit to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I go to the gym once a week to keep fit and get slimmer. I also do yoga at home for two hours after dinner.</li>
<li>Did you like to go outside when you were young?<br>
I loved to go outside when I was young. There was a park nearby my house when I was in primary school, and my parents would often bring me over there to have fun with my friends. We could spend the whole day in the park without getting bored.<br>
3.Did you often go over to your friends’ house when you were young?<br>
Yes, I did. My friends invite me to their houses quite a lot and I’ve developed a good relationship with their parents. They often treat me with food and drinks and chat with me about interesting things about their work. The things I learned from them were fascinating.</li>
<li>Is it important for children to play outdoors?<br>
I think it’s really important for people to encourage their children to play outdoors. Having some outdoor<br>
activities could keep children healthy and strong. Playing outdoors would also help them release some stress that was built during long time studies and school work.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="plan">Plan</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do you make plans every day?<br>
Not necessarily. I make plans for myself about things that I must complete each day, and I would mark off any tasks that I’ve completed after doing it. However, I don’t really specify what time I would complete it because it doesn’t really matter to me as long as I complete it in the specified date.</li>
<li>Are you good at managing your time?<br>
I’m pretty good at managing my time. I often estimate the amount of time that’s required to finish a certain task, and save some time between each task as little breaks.</li>
<li>What is the latest plan you’ve made?<br>
Just a few days ago, a childhood friend of mine that I haven’t seen for a long time contacted me on social media， asking me to go to a reunion party and see my old primary school friends at a restaurant. It has been quite some time since we parted ways after graduating primary school, so I made plans with them and wrote it in my agenda.</li>
<li>What is the hardest part about making plans?<br>
The hardest part about making plans for me is when something unexpected occurs and disrupts my original plan. I get stood up by some friends sometimes, because they only tell me an hour before the meetups. It’s really hard to adapt to the sudden change in plan, but I manage to work them out in the end.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="math">Math</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do you often use a calculator?<br>
Yes. I do often use a calculator because I feel that it is much faster and convenient when I am doing my Math exercises. Especially when I am solving some complicated algebra questions, a functional calculator can be used as a useful tool for it.</li>
<li>Are girls generally good at mathematics?<br>
General speaking, girls are not as good as boys at mathematics, especially in the past. But nowadays, there are more and more girls who are interested in the field of Science and Engineering. Some of them are better than boys in the Math study and even at their work.</li>
<li>Do you think it is difficult to learn mathematics well?<br>
Yes. To learn mathematics well requires at least three main factors: interest, diligence, and some degree of abilities in abstract thinking and understanding. This is because compared with other subjects, Math involves more abstract concepts and logical inferences.</li>
<li>Do you think mathematics is important?<br>
Mathematics is an important basic course for students to study because it educates and trains students for their comprehensive ability in abstract thinking, analysis and deduction. It is also the basic tool of the study in all science and engineering. And it plays an important role in the development of human society and propels the society forward.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="travel">Travel</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do you like travelling?<br>
Yes, I really enjoy travelling, especially by myself. It’s a great way to release all the stress built up at school. I go on some trips to different cities nearby every year during the summer break. I book and order all the tickets and flights by myself, and it’s more affordable.</li>
<li>Which cities have you travelled to?<br>
I’ve been to places like Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing. I enjoyed all the sceneries and food during my trip. I’m still a student, I can’t afford to go to other countries and travel by myself. But I’ve been to Kyoto, Japan with my parents. It was a great family trip and we had a lot of fun there together.</li>
<li>What kind of cities do you like to travel to?<br>
I like going to the cities that I could try a lot of delicious food. I really enjoy trying out different food from different cities and experiencing the diffident cultures from places. You could also learn about the histories of places as you have the food. A lot of food such as stinky tofu can date back to Ancient China.</li>
<li>What is the place that left you the deepest impression when travelling?<br>
Japan is probably the most impressive country I’ve ever been to. The clean streets and the politeness of the people have left me the deepest impressions. There was absolutely no garbage that was left on the ground, and all the places I’ve been to were extremely clean and tidy. People were also very polite when they interact with each other.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="market">Market</h1>
<ol>
<li>What do street markets sell?<br>
Out of all the street markets I’ve been to, almost all of them sell authentic Chinese street food, such as stinky tofu in Hunan, Changfen in Guangdong and other foods that are special in each continent. Street food are usually made to order and offered in smaller sizes for your convenience.</li>
<li>Are there many street markets in China?<br>
There are quite a lot of street markets in China. If you go out on the streets in the middle of the night, you could see hundreds of people still sitting on the side of the streets, savouring the snacks they’ve bought from the vendors. It’s an unspoken tradition for people to have midnight snacks in China.</li>
<li>What are the differences between street markets and supermarkets?<br>
Supermarkets tend to sell food that’s made using machines, such as frozen foods and boxed snacks. However, if<br>
you go to a local street market in China, you could find tons of homemade and authentic Chinese street food sold in different vendors. They are also cheaper than the frozen food sold in the supermarkets.</li>
<li>Do you often go to the supermarkets?<br>
I do. Even though supermarkets have a lot of frozen foods in the freezers, they still sell fresh produces. Living alone as a student, I go to the supermarkets once every week to stock up fresh produces in my fridge. I make most of my meals every week, other than the times where I’m incredibly tired after school</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="friends">Friends</h1>
<ol>
<li>What do you think makes good friends<br>
I think the most important thing about a good friend is the sincerity. If you want to become a good friend, it’s important to actually be sincere in this relationship, and don’t hesitate to show your genuineness to your friends.</li>
<li>Do you keep in contact with friends from your childhood?<br>
I’m actually not in contact with my friends from my childhood anymore. I have their contacts on social media, and I see their posts once in a while, however, we don’t message one another anymore, because it has been so long since the last time I talked to them.</li>
<li>What kinds of people do you like to make friends with?<br>
I like to make friends with people who are energetic and playful. I enjoy having company so I won’t get too bored during the days. I also like making friends with people who have the same interest as me, because it helps create more topics when having conversations.</li>
<li>Do you think you are a good friend or others?<br>
I think I am a good friend to others, because I am cheerful and I don’t get angry easily. I often joke around with friends, and I’m usually the mood-maker in my group of friends. So I think my friends love to have my company.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="movies">Movies</h1>
<ol>
<li>What’s your favourite movie?<br>
I have quite a lot of favorite movies, but my most favorite movie would definitely be Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse. It has great graphics and plot, which makes it suitable for all ages to watch. I’ve watched it over five times since it came out.</li>
<li>Do your friends like this movie?<br>
Of course, all of my friends who watched it told me they loved it. I went to watch this movie with a friend, and after the movie, we couldn’t stop talking about how great the animation and graphics were, and how beautiful the plot and character settings were.</li>
<li>What kinds of movies do you think young people like<br>
I think young people would like movies that have more action and drama. These genres tend to allow young adults to stay focused on the movie, because it’s exciting and attention-grabbing. Movies like a documentary 9<br>
would probably put young people to sleep.</li>
<li>Do you want to be a movie star?<br>
I used to want to become a movie actor when I was young. I was featured in a school play back when I was in primary school. However, I don’t think I have the ability to become a movie star now that I’ve grown up, and I have no experience in acting ever since elementary.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="animals">Animals</h1>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever kept pets?<br>
I once had a poodle when I was in primary school. I named her Kuro, which means Black in Japanese. She was only six months old when it joined our family. Unfortunately, we had to send her away after a few weeks, because we noticed my mom getting allergic reactions.</li>
<li>Do you like to go to the zoo?<br>
I really like to go to the zoo, because I get to see rare animals that people don’t often see in their daily lives. It’s awesome to see different animals that I’ve never seen before, and every time I go to the zoo, I realize that there’s way more animals in this world than I imagined.</li>
<li>Have you ever seen any wild animals before?<br>
I’ve seen a wild red fox when I was on a vacation with my mom to Canada. My mom and I were talking and taking a stroll that day, and we stopped talking and stood in shock when we saw the fox, casually walking past us on a street, only a few meters away.</li>
<li>What wild animals do you like most?<br>
I really like clouded leopards (云豹). Clouded leopards are medium sized cats that are beautiful and majestic.<br>
They don’t have strong roars like some of the big cats, which makes them cute at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="languages">Languages</h1>
<ol>
<li>What languages can you speak?<br>
I speak Chinese and English. Chinese is my first language and English is my second language. I’ve been trying to learn a little Japanese by myself during the summer break, but I haven’t progressed much, because I don’t have a lot of Japanese friends to have conversations with.</li>
<li>Do you think it is difficult to learn a new language?<br>
I think it’s not that difficult to learn a new language. The most important thing about learning a new language is to practice. I like to learn a new language by watching TV and having conversations with friends. It doesn’t matter if you can’t speak fluently yet, because mistakes help you grow faster.</li>
<li>Will you learn other languages in the future?<br>
I wish I could learn Japanese in the future. I’ve been checking out a lot of videos about the different cultures in Japan, and I wish to go to Japan on a vacation in the future. Learning Japanese before going on the trip would come in handy.</li>
<li>Why do you learn English?<br>
I learn English because English has become the most spoken language on the planet, it has become a universal language. By learning English, I would be able to speak decent English with people from other countries without expressing my message incorrectly.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="voice">Voice</h1>
<ol>
<li>Has your voice ever changed?<br>
My voice had changed quite hard as I grew up. My voice used to be pretty high pitched when I was young, but as I grew up, it started getting deeper and deeper. In the end, my voice turned quite deep, which is very different compared to my voice when I was young.</li>
<li>Do you enjoy recording your voice and listening to it?<br>
I don’t really listen to my voice in a recording, because it sounds a lot different to how I actually sound in real life. I find that voice recordings tend to make my voice go higher pitched, which sounds really cute, and I’m actually not really used to it.</li>
<li>Do you like your own voice?<br>
I really like my own voice. When I talk slowly with confidence, I think it gives an impression to people that I’m mature and thoughtful. I also like singing because I like my own voice; however, I never record my own singing because it sounds really weird in recordings.</li>
<li>Does your voice sound similar to your parents?<br>
Surprisingly, my voice sounds nothing like my parents. My mom has a really high-pitched tone, while my dad has a mediocre voice that’s not really deep. My parents often joked that I didn’t sound like their kid back when I was in high school.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="concentration">Concentration</h1>
<ol>
<li>When do you need to be focused?<br>
Currently I need to focus on my university study. Since my major is visual arts, I need to spend most of the time on projects and homework. Concentration on study is my priority for these four years.</li>
<li>What many distract you when you are trying to stay focused?<br>
To be honest, too much chatting online with friends is distracting me when I am trying to stay focused on my school study. Wechat is a good communication tool for today’s young generation, however, I am trying to control the time I spend on it every day.</li>
<li>What do you do to help you concentrate?<br>
In order to keep my concentration on study, I usually shut down my cellphone or go to the library to study for a few hours. Besides, I often find a study room at school where no friends can find me. In this way, I can focus on my homework by myself.</li>
<li>Is it difficult for you to stay focused on something?<br>
Yes. When there are so many friends chatting with me online or hanging out together, it is difficult for me to stay focused on my study. When I am captivated with my favourite animation, I cannot concentrate on my homework at home. In general, I have difficulty to stay focused on something for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="jeans">Jeans</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do you wear jeans?<br>
Yes. I usually wear jeans when I hang out with my friends. We often go for hiking, dancing and seeing movies during our holidays. Wearing jeans is a kind of fashion trend for today’s young generation.</li>
<li>How often do you wear jeans?<br>
I often wear jeans at weekends, especially every Saturday. Since Saturday is a leisure time for me to relax after a week’s study at school. During my vacations and holidays, I also like to wear jeans to go travel with my family.</li>
<li>Do you like wearing jeans, why?<br>
I like wearing jeans because it shows my body figure perfectly. And it is also a fashion trend for our young generation. I also like wearing jeans because they’re stylish. Furthermore, they are always leading the trend of the casual wears.</li>
<li>Why do you think jeans are popular in China?<br>
In China, people like to wear jeans in all kinds of occasions, formal and informal, weekdays and weekends, indoors and outdoors. The other reason I think jeans are popular in China is because people from older to younger generations like to wear jeans no matter if it is in winter or in summer. And there are a lot of stores and shops selling jeans everywhere in China.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="haircut">Haircut</h1>
<ol>
<li>What’s your favourite hairstyle?<br>
My favourite hairstyle is short straight hair. Since I am living in Southern China, it is extremely hot in summer. And I sweat a lot when it is hot. So a short straight hair style is suitable and favourable to me.</li>
<li>How often do you have your hair cut?<br>
My short straight hair style helps me to avoid going to the barber, so I go much less than my friends. I only have my hair cut every two weeks. Since I am currently studying in the university, I do not have too much money and time to keep changing my hairstyle.</li>
<li>How much do you usually spend on your haircut?<br>
I usually spend only one hundred yuan a month for my haircut. Every two weeks, it costs me fifty yuan to go to barber. It is a reasonable price for a simple hair cut nowadays.</li>
<li>Do you often change your haircut?<br>
No. I am not keen on changing my hairstyle, especially as I am a student currently. I need to concentrate on my school study all the time so that I can find a good job after graduation. Then I will think about changing my haircut or hairstyle more often.</li>
<li>How long have you had your current haircut?<br>
I have had my current haircut for at least two years since I entered into the university. I would like to focus on the study instead of my appearance for the coming two years in the school. And this is also because the weather in Guangzhou is terribly hot in summer.</li>
<li>Have you ever had an unhappy haircut?<br>
Yes. I remember that in the summer vacation during my high school I was unhappy with my haircut. I was going back to my hometown with my parents. Since it is in the countryside, it is really hard for me to find a good barber. So I had to accept what the only barber in the village had done to my hair.</li>
<li>Do you like to have your hair cut?<br>
Yes. I do like to have my hair cut. But I do not like to change my hairstyle too often. My favourite hairstyle is the short straight hair, and I do not like to have my hair dyed into other colours.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="walking">Walking</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do you walk a lot?<br>
I do not walk a lot because I am not very interested in outdoor activities. In fact, I enjoy indoor exercises, such as Yoga, Aerobics and table tennis. I would like to take a walk only if I have eaten too much at dinner.</li>
<li>Do you walk more often than in the past?<br>
No. Since I am studying visual arts in the university, I have less time to go out for a walk. A lot of projects and homework I have to work on not only in the day, but also at night. I spend a lot of time on shopping, chatting and studying online instead of any outdoor activities.</li>
<li>Do you think people will walk more or not in the future?<br>
I think more and more people will walk less in the future. With the development of AI and different kinds of apps in cellphones, people do not need to walk more to get what they want. They can order everything online, meeting and chatting with friends by video calls. AI will meet their needs for indoor and outdoor.</li>
<li>Where do you usually take a walk?<br>
I usually take a walk in the park near my home. The park is a small but clean place for people to spend their leisure time, especially for the older generation. I like to take a walk over there because my parents like to be with me while they take a walk after dinner.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="countryside">Countryside</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do you like to live in countryside in the future?<br>
Yes. Although I am currently living in the city, I still like would to move to the countryside someday when I have my own family. This is because I would like to have a bigger space and a clean and healthy living environment for my baby to grow.</li>
<li>What would you like to do in the countryside?<br>
Living in the countryside, I would like to farm my own vegetable in my backyard so that I can eat healthy foods planted by myself every day. And I would like to raise and walk a dog in the field instead of keeping it at home. The most important thing I would like to do in the countryside is to breathe the fresh air while I am doing exercises.</li>
<li>How long have you lived in countryside?<br>
To be honest, I have only lived in countryside for a few days. It was because I went to my hometown to see my cousin with my parents. When I saw the green field, beautiful flowers and the little hill behind our old house in the countryside, I was attracted by the peaceful, quiet and healthy living environment over there.</li>
<li>What’s the benefits of living in rural areas?<br>
Living in rural areas, you can breathe the fresh air, have a bigger living space and healthier food than living in the cities. Besides, you can also have a quiet and peaceful quality of life. Less people and less pollution are also the advantages of living in rural areas.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="scenery1-4-月新题">Scenery(1-4 月新题)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Is there good scenery in your hometown?<br>
Yes, of course. There are many famous tourist attractions in my hometown, such as the Canton Tower, Pearl River and Baiyun Mountain. But I have been to these places so many times that they are not as attractive to me anymore.</li>
<li>When you travel, do you like to live in hotels with scenic views?<br>
No, I don’t. Because the hotels with scenic views are usually very expensive. I can go to the scenery in the daytime even though it will take me a little time to get there. I think staying in expensive hotels is a high cost way to travel.</li>
<li>Do you like to take pictures of good scenery with your smartphone? Why?<br>
I like to use my smartphone to take pictures. My Huawei P30 has incredible photography functions. While on the journey, I always use my Huawei cellphone to take pictures for my friends. All of them are always astonished by the good effects of the pictures.</li>
<li>Is there good scenery in cities?<br>
It depends. I think a skyline of skyscrapers is good scenery which I appreciate. But some people don’t, they may consider natural landscape as the best kind of scenery.</li>

Pen, of course. The cartridge of the pencil is so fragile that it often breaks off easily. However, pen is much more durable, even if you drop it to the ground many times, it still works.</li>

I don’t remember actually. Now I have several pens on hand. All of them were given as a present in school activities. So, I haven’t bought a pen for long time.</li>

Like I said above, when I am home alone, I like to watch movies. But on a nice day, I also enjoy reading a book or exercising outside.</li>

</ol>
<h1 id="water-sports1-4-月新题">Water sports(1-4 月新题)</h1>

I have done some, but not many. When I travelled to Phuket Island, I played on a banana boat and snorkeled. They were really exciting and relaxing sports.</li>

I like snorkeling, although I have not snorkeled many times. It is an easy way to explore the ocean and doesn’t require complex skills. All I need to do it is to wear the suit and snorkeling mask and use the breathing tube.</li>
<li>What kind of water sports do you want to try?<br>
I want to try deep diving. Because compared to snorkeling, deep diving would let me go deeper and see more sea creatures, such as turtles and crabs. However, deep diving requires certain skills, which take time to practice.</li>

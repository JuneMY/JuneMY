        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About this book<br>
这本书由英国著名作家George Orwell所著，1945年于英国首次出版。从文体上来看，这是一本寓言小说，反映了1917年俄国革命至斯大林时期的历史故事。《时代杂志》将这本书评选为1923-2005年100佳英文小说。</p>
<p>About the author<br>
George Orwell是著名小说家、记者和社会评论家。他以其敏锐的洞察力和犀利的文笔审视和记录着他所生活的那个时代。</p>
<p>故事开始于英格兰威灵顿的一个农场，由于原主人琼斯先生管理不善，激起了农场内动物的造反之意。在一头老公猪“少校”的指领下，小动物们进行了造反并且成功了。老少校死后，农场主要由其它两头公猪领导着，分别是雪球和拿破仑。一开始，他们和农场的其它小动物严格遵守着【动物主义七戒】，大家一起努力，建设着理想中的农场。后来建设美好家园的列车却越来越朝着相反的方向驶去。【七戒】不断被修改，直到最后谁都不记得曾经的是什么了。</p>
<p>我的感想<br>
一月份的时候我就看完了这本书，又是停了这么久才开始写写自己的想法。这次动笔时间晚，最主要的原因是，想法太多，但是又太杂乱，不知道如何说起。读的时候想到了很多，政府，权力，人民，洗脑，历史，等等，等等。如果全部都聊一遍的话，将会是一个浩大的工程，而且，感觉我目前的知识储备也无法支持我对这些话题侃侃而谈，简单针对单个问题发表批判性的言论的话，连我自己都知道那将会是多么的肤浅，所以不打算进行任何的批评，只是想针对其中的某些片段结合我自己的感受聊一聊。</p>
<p>全部写完以后，发现有点不是很合适放在这里，就决定只展示一部分的笔记，至少证明我看过我写过，剩下的笔记就先躺在我的icloud里吧，以后有机会了再展示。</p>

<p><strong>What are the benefits of younger and older generations living together? How about the drawbacks?</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons to live with people from a different generation. They can teach us many things and we can learn about our culture and traditions. However, some drawbacks would be that they are <strong><tagname style="color:red">they are stuck in their ways</tagname></strong> and find it difficult to understand the younger generation.</p>
<p><strong>Which do you prefer, support from family members or friends? Why?</strong></p>
<p>I think that support from family members is <strong><tagname style="color:red">better than</tagname></strong> support from friends. Your family will love you <strong><tagname style="color:red">without any judgement</tagname></strong> and they will always be there when you need them. They also don’t expect anything in return, and they <strong><tagname style="color:red">support you unconditionally</tagname></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How many generations do each family have?</strong></p>
<p>Families can have <strong><tagname style="color:red">up to four generations</tagname></strong>. There can be great grandparents, grandparents, parents and children. Families that have this many generations are lucky, and they can learn a lot from each other. They should spend quality time with their elders and <strong><tagname style="color:red">savour the moments they share together</tagname></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Is it important to visit family members? Why?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to <tagname style="color:red">keep in touch with</tagname>our family members and visit them <strong><tagname style="color:red">as often as we can</tagname></strong>. Our family loves us unconditionally and is always be there for us. We can also learn a lot from older generations and life is too short not to make time for them.</p>
<h2 id="教导你的人">教导你的人</h2>
<p><strong>What qualities do you think a good teacher should have?</strong><br>
Being a teacher is not everyone’s cup of tea and there are some special qualities that you should have in order to be a great teacher. Patience and kindness are the top qualities of any good teacher I have met, and every teacher should <strong><tagname style="color:red">possess</tagname></strong> them.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think can learn better? Old people or youngsters?</strong><br>
I think that youngsters can learn new skills better than older people. They are <strong><tagname style="color:red">more open to</tagname></strong> new ideas and they are willing to try new things. Older people however are <strong><tagname style="color:red">set in their ways</tagname></strong>  and it can be difficult for them to learn.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the best age for children to go to school?</strong><br>
In my opinion, children should <strong><tagname style="color:red">attend school</tagname></strong>  after seven years old. The first years of their lives are important, and they should be <strong><tagname style="color:red">filled with play and imagination</tagname></strong>. School can be very rigid, and it can be difficult for young children to pay attention for long periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Do you prefer to study by yourself or with your friends?</strong><br>
My ideal study environment is to study by myself <strong><tagname style="color:red">away from others and distractions</tagname></strong>. I think that it is easy to <strong><tagname style="color:red">get off track</tagname></strong> when you study with friends. However, when you are studying alone, you are able to concentrate better and <strong><tagname style="color:red">stay on top of things</tagname></strong>.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of traveling by plane?<br>
There are several advantages of traveling by plane. The most obvious advantages are the ability to travel great distances in a shorter period of time, the convenience, and that traveling by plane is the safest way to travel! Plane travel allows people to maximize their time at their destination because they are spending less time in transit. A flight between Beijing and Guangzhou is only about three and half hours compared to over 20 hours when driving by car. Also, air travel is considerably safer than driving and is considered the safest means of transportation. Traveling by plane is fast, convenient and safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people prefer to travel by train?<br>
Many people prefer to travel by train. To begin with, it is much less expensive to travel by train than other modes of transportation and it is more comfortable. This is important when traveling with a family. If the destination is not a great distance away, it may actually be faster and more convenient to go by train! Also, passengers can see the beautiful countryside and, for longer trips, buy sleeping accommodations so they can arrive refreshed. Finally, compared to travel by air, people have much more freedom to move around. For instance, they can get up to walk to the dining car for something to eat. There are many reasons to prefer travel by train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the disadvantages of living near an airport?<br>
I think the main disadvantages of living near an airport are the noise and air pollution. Airplanes are noisy and this noise is very disruptive. If people live near a large airport, they can expect to hear noise 24 hours a day. Not only can this noise be disruptive during the day, but it can interfere with sleep. Of course, the sound of airplanes is louder outside and that may limit people’s desire to enjoy outdoor recreation. In addition to the noise pollution outdoors, the air quality may be negatively affected and that can be unhealthy. When considering the noise and poorer air quality, I would definitely prefer not to live near an airport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is working at the airport different from working at other places?<br>
Airports are unique because of their strict schedules. Employees need to place a high emphasis on customer satisfaction even though they are working under the pressure of constant deadlines. Every step of the flight process must be strictly, and politely, monitored so that these schedules are met. This includes everything from check in, checking luggage, gate operations, boarding, and deplaning. And all of this must be done while ensuring customers are happy with their experience. This becomes complicated when things happen outside of an employee’s control, like severe weather that causes flight delays. Then employees are dealing with large numbers of upset customers. This is very stressful and exhausting. Very few industries have the pressure to maintain schedules as closely as airports and employees have to do it with a smile no matter how tired they are!</p>

<p>Do you think it is strange to make friends online?<br>
I don’t think it is strange at all to make friends online! I can meet people with common interests and communicate conveniently through social media. While it is important to be careful sharing information when developing friendships online, I have met many people who have similar interests by participating in forums dedicated to my interests. For instance, I enjoy photography and have received excellent advice on where to buy quality equipment inexpensively from an online friend. Another thing I especially like about meeting people online is that we can communicate through social media. It makes communication more relaxed because we can “talk” on our own schedule without lengthy time obligations. I definitely count my online friends as my friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people have few friends?<br>
Some people have only a few friends because they feel true friendships take time to nurture and develop. For instance, I have many acquaintances, but only a few close friends. I consider a friend to be someone I have known for a while and can confide in. In my mind, it takes time and many interactions to grow from being an acquaintance into a trusted friend. That is why some of my friends are people I have known since elementary school, while other friendships I have developed more recently are with people who I have spent more time with. When I go out with a group of people, I am friendly with everyone, but only a few are truly my friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is more important, new friendships or old ones?<br>
Although I think both old and new friendships are special, I think new ones may be more important. People’s interests, stage of life, and even where they live can change. I have great memories of my childhood friend, Laura, and we remain in touch through social media. When I go home, I will be sure to visit with her. However, now that I have graduated and started my new job in a new city, I am meeting friends through work and am spending time with them. I have also met people in my building. I think it is only natural to develop new friendships as our life circumstances change. While I can maintain contact with old friends, sometimes it makes more sense to put time and energy into new friendships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do companies welcome their new employees?<br>
To begin with, usually on the first day, new employees will be given a tour of the department and building by a supervisor and will be introduced to their colleagues. Companies want to welcome their new employees because they hope they will have a long and successful business association together. Secondly, when companies hire new employees, there often is an orientation meeting which allows the company to give new employees important information about policies and procedures. This orientation also allows the new employees to meet each other if they work in different departments. Lastly, frequently supervisors will invite the new employees to dinner so they can get to know each other better. These are all ways to make new employees feel welcome.</p>

<li>
<p>Is colour important for clothing?<br>
Colour is very important for clothing and is vital to learn about. It is especially important to dress in appropriate colours for specific occasions. Also, colours mean different things in different cultures. For instance, if you are invited to a wedding in the United States, the bride wears white as it is the colour of purity. If a guest wears all white, it is considered rude. While in China, black is associated with mourning and would never be appropriate to wear for anyone to wear at a wedding. Moreover, appropriate colours are also important in business. You have to dress appropriately for interviews and meeting clients because you will be judged on this first impression. Generally, muted colours are best as those are more accepted in the workplace. Colour choice in clothing says a lot about an individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should course-books be colourful?<br>
Absolutely. Colourful course-books create interest compared to a text book that is printed only in black and white. While this would make the cost to produce the course-book more expensive, not to mention the price to purchase it, it would make the book so much more readable. Firstly, charts and illustrations can be highlighted with colour to point out the significant points more clearly. Colour contrast can also be used to show comparative information and exceptions more clearly. Secondly, photographs stand out and look so much more real in colour than if they are printed in grey-scale. These are the differences that can make a course-book more interesting to read and easier to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What colour do you think people would choose when decorating their houses?<br>
Colour selections for someone’s home is a very individual choice because it sets the mood they want for each room. Personally, I tend to like neutral colours that represent wood, earth, and water tones for wall colours. Also, these wall tones don’t clash with each other as you walk from room to room. I feel these neutral colours can easily be accented with brighter colours to make a room look more complete. Colour can be added through curtains, pillows, and wall hangings to create the desired mood. Also, these items can also be easily changed to create a different look without having to change the wall colour. However, like I said at the beginning, colour is a very individual choice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think the colour of a company’s dress code represents the image of the corporation?<br>
The management of a company puts time and money into developing the company dress code in order to express their desired image. The company is trying to project the principles and standards of their company through colour. They want their customers and vendors to have trust and confidence in their business product and the company as a whole. Also, when everyone follows the dress code, it shows people outside of the company that the employees feel united and loyal. Besides, the colour of a company’s dress code may be different depending on the type of corporation. A conservative accounting business would most probably have a conservative grey colour to display confidence whereas a food corporation might have green to represent freshness. Colour definitely represents the image of the company!</p>

<p>What is the difference between current teachers and those in the past?<br>
While both current and past teachers have always wanted what is best for their students, I think today’s teachers pay more attention to the comprehensive development of students. Current teachers definitely focus on academics, but they also try to help students cultivate a variety of interests and hobbies to make the student more well-rounded, and hopefully a happier and healthier person. The emphasis in the past was solely on a student’s academic performance. Teachers in the past were more concerned with forcing students to complete their assignments and even punishing those who did not by corporal punishment. Today’s teachers have a more holistic view of each student than teachers in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between being taught by teachers and by AI<br>
I think the main difference is that teachers can provide human interaction to students. A good teacher is able to recognize when a student is struggling when learning before the student becomes frustrated. Students know that a person is there to help them with the learning process and acknowledge them when they succeed! However, if students are being taught by AI, they may not have the opportunity to tell the AI what they really need or get answers to their questions. What’s more, another difference between them may be the quality of the teacher vs. the AI. Although there are many teachers in our country, there are not always enough good teachers. An AI may also be a good option if there is a shortage of teachers in a specific subject area. Moreover, AI may be a way for motivated students with aptitude in the subject area to learn at his or her own pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between private schools and public schools?<br>
There are many differences between private and public schools. First, private schools generally have smaller class sizes and a more rigorous curriculum than public schools. Sometimes this curriculum is focused on a specific subject area, like languages, mathematics, or the arts. Secondly, private schools are very expensive with high tuition rates; not all of the families in China can afford them. So, the private school is also called the ‘exclusive school’ in China. Last, since public schools are generally larger than private schools, there is often a larger variety of activities that students can be involved in after school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between international schools and other schools?<br>
There are many differences between international schools and other schools in China. To begin with, International schools are mainly attended by foreign students and have more emphasis on the study of English. Also, they usually follow the same curriculum as schools in the United States or Great Britain. Subjects like social studies are presented from a global perspective and are often integrated with other subjects like science, etc. On the other hand, regular schools generally teach Chinese students in Mandarin. They have a specific educational goal for each student. Their emphasis is on educating each student to be able to pass and get good marks for the university entrance examination.</p>

<h1 id="no-5-很累却要保持清醒">No. 5 很累却要保持清醒</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What kind of people lack sleep?<br>
I think most people suffer from lack of sleep, at least most people between the ages of 12 and 60! People are putting in long hours to get their work done, dealing with stress, and trying to balance work and home. When time is short, sleep is often cut short too. Additionally, the worry associated with this stress often disrupts a person’s sleep and make it not as refreshing as it should be. Students put a great deal of time into their studies for exams and are worrying about their future choices. Adults also deal with deadlines and usually work long hours. The stress of balancing work and family life also interferes with both the amount of time set aside for sleep and quality of sleep. It is a difficult cycle for people to deal with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people feel tired a lot nowadays?<br>
I think people feel tired because sleep is the first thing people sacrifice when they “run out of time”. As I said in the last question, people have a lot of responsibilities by studying and working a lot of hours, along with the stress of trying to balance life and work. Everything seems to be a priority except sleep. While learning and using time management skills won’t cure the problem all of the time for everyone, I think using good time management skills will help people focus to be able to get more done and allow them to prioritise sleep as part a healthy routine!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do people keep awake when they are tired?<br>
I think I know all the tricks to stay awake when I am tired. Drinking caffeinated drinks is usually the first thing I try. Turning lights on brighter around me helps trick my mind into thinking it is really isn’t as late as it is. Sometimes a few minutes of activity will clear my head like a brisk walk. Splashing cold water on my face and wrists can help me be more alert. My last trick is to take several deep breaths to get oxygen flowing and this is more effective if I stretch with the breathing. There are lots of ways to try to stay awake when you are tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What occasions do people need to keep awake even though they feel tired?<br>
There are many occasions that people need to keep awake no matter how tired they are. I divide them into ‘urgent’, ‘important’, and ‘should’ occasions. Staying awake while driving is an urgent situation and if you can’t stay awake, it is important to stop until you can. There are many important occasions that it is better to be awake, but isn’t a “life or death” situation like driving. For example, staying awake in class is important for obvious reasons. A “should’ occasion example is when my family went to a play last month. My father fell asleep and my mother was so angry. It definitely would have been better for him if stayed awake! I think we can all think of many occasions where we struggled to stay alert!</p>

<p>How do people usually choose gifts?<br>
Gifts are meant to make other people happy. So, people usually give a great deal of thought about the type of occasion, what others want, and about what they can afford to spend before choosing a gift! These things don’t always align, so often there is a lot to think about. For occasions like a for young child’s birthday party, a small, fun gift like an inexpensive toy is very appropriate and delights the child receiving it. Other times, giving money is the best option. This way the people receiving the gift can decide what they want for themselves, for instance for a wedding or house warming gift. If a person is financially well-off and does not want or need anything, often the best idea is to give a hand-made gift. These will provide the sentimental value that will make the recipient happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people find it hard to choose gifts?<br>
Some people really struggle choosing a gift because they want to give the perfect gift that will make the recipient happy and feel special. A gift doesn’t have to be expensive to be appreciated and well-received, however the choice of a gift is also a reflection on the giver. If someone chooses a gift without putting any thought into it, the recipient will know that and will be disappointed. Also, there are so many choices when buying a gift and being able to buy things on-line offers even more options to choose from. Sometimes it’s just hard to make a decision and settle on that perfect gift!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think useful gifts are always more suitable than those useless ones?<br>
Sometimes I think getting a frivolous gift is fun, but in general, I think useful gifts are much better to give and receive. For example, suppose a teenage girl gets an oversized stuffed animal and a bag for her 16th birthday. It lightens everyone’s mood when she unwraps the stuffed animal and everyone says it is “cute”. However, it isn’t a very practical gift and will probably be thrown out and forgotten very soon. On the other hand, the bag is something she will use and enjoy repeatedly. A practical and useful gift will be a longer lasting memento of the occasion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people give the same gifts as they did in the past?<br>
I don't think so. There are a variety of new choices of gifts to give because of advances in electronics and the ability to buy things from the internet. Nowadays, everyone wants the latest models of electronics, like cell phones, tablets, or wireless accessories. It makes for many new choices! My mother just purchased a tablet for my grandmother. It has the same functionality as a cell phone, but she is able to see screen better. This would never have been a possibility a generation ago! However, gifts in the past were limited to what could be made or purchased locally. I think that is the difference. Besides, giving money for certain occasions has been customary for a long time and continues to be appropriate.</p>

<h1 id="no-7-借过的好用东西">No. 7 借过的好用东西</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What kind of things do people borrow from each other?<br>
I think of small things that people borrow because they need or want them for a short period of time. I have some books that I am happy to let friends borrow. My friend and I are the same size and we will sometimes share clothes. My father needed a tool to change a light fixture and borrowed it from a neighbour. Last month, I forgot money for lunch as school and my teacher saw that I wasn’t eating and loaned me money for food. I was sure to pay her back the next day. I am uncomfortable borrowing money, even in small amounts! People usually avoid borrowing expensive things, like computers, because you are responsible for it and would feel terrible if it broke while you had it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the things that people do not choose to lend to others?<br>
Like I said in my last answer, people don’t really like to loan money or expensive items. If you loan someone money and they can not pay you back like you had agreed, the relationship will become strained and even ruined. Other things that people don’t like to lend are expensive things like electronics or sentimental items like family heirlooms. If something happened to them while they were in the possession of someone else, they could be expensive or even impossible to repair. Not that anyone would be purposely careless, but things happen in life. If I loaned my laptop to my best friend, I know she would do her best to take care of it, but she accidentally dropped it, I know I would feel resentful because of the inconvenience it would cause me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we always need to get permissions from others before using something they have?<br>
Yes, we should always get permission from others before using their possessions. If you don’t, that is stealing! That is a point I keep trying to tell my younger brother who thinks nothing of coming into my room and “borrowing” my things. He has borrowed my tennis racket, my electronics, and even music from my music collection without asking. It would not be so bad if I didn’t have to go into his room to get them back! Of course, I would lend these items to him, but if he would ask first, I would know where these items were so I wouldn’t be looking for them thinking that I misplaced them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think of copying ideas from others?<br>
This is a difficult question because I think that someone can take a good idea and make it even better. However, I think credit has to be given to the person who thought of the idea to begin with. Then the question comes up, what if this person doesn’t want you to use their idea. If you can’t convince him or her to work with you on it, then I think it is better to try to find your own creative thoughts around the that idea to come up with your own work. Ideas can always be improved on and that’s what helps science growing and expanding. It is important to share ideas, but I don’t think copying them is fair.</p>

<p>Should kids know more about stars and planets?<br>
Kids should learn about the stars and planets. This is a science that has been studied since ancient times. So much is known about space and there is so much more to learn. While most kids no longer need to know how to navigate the ocean by the stars, it is fascinating to notice how the stars “change” in the sky depending on the time and season. This allow students to know more about the Earth’s rotation and our position in the universe. The advances used in the study of space have helped many other areas of science and is beneficial for everyone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is high technology helpful for star watching?<br>
Star watching can be done with everything from the naked eye on a particularly dark night to a very expensive telescope. A lot can be learned by looking at the night skies with only your eyes and matching them with images of the constellations. It is easy and inexpensive to learn the location and names of prominent stars this way. However, there is inexpensive technology that can be very helpful too. There are apps that you can download on your phone and as you position your phone in a certain direction, it will identify what you are looking at for you. Nowadays, technology makes stars and planets accessible to everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of people are interested in stars?<br>
I think people who are interested in the stars are filled with curiosity about things they can’t touch and feel. There is so little known about the stars, people use their curiosity and imagination to fuel their interest in learning more. Most of these people are just so impressed with the immense majesty of the stars and planets that they enjoy sky watching! Some people make star watching more of a hobby. They may buy an inexpensive telescope and go to remote areas on weekends and look for specific astronomical events. Still others want to know the answers to questions about space and everything in it and study stars in earnest!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people like to watch movies about stars or planets?<br>
Many people enjoy movies about stars or planets because they can spark your imagination. There is a genre called “science fiction” and many of these movies are about people going to other planets and exploring. Often, they are learning about how to live in that planet’s atmosphere and sometimes they interact with alien life who look very different from us. The more modern movies about stars or planets have brilliant video effects about space travel that capture your interest. These are things no one would ever see on earth, and even though it is just fiction, it can be fun to imagine going to other planets!</p>

<p>What do you think is more important? Reading or writing?<br>
This is not an easy question at all because both are important, but I think the ability to read is more important than writing because it needs to be learned first. If a person reads enough different material, they will naturally develop into a good writer. They will become familiar with vocabulary and different sentence structures through their reading and will use these in their writing. Reading allows people to understand what ideas other people are trying communicate. This allow people to learn through their reading. However, people who do not write well can try to get their thoughts and ideas across to others through speech and, perhaps, even art!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who needs to have good writing skills?<br>
It is so important for everyone to be able to write; it will be hard to narrow down to specific groups of people! News and magazine writers need to be able to write concisely, without personal bias, so people will know and understand the events happening in the world. It may be especially important for people who work in scientific fields like medicine, so there is clarity when it comes to medical advances and patient care. The ability to write is important for people in the legal profession so that laws are written without ambiguity and are easy to interpret. I think anyone in authority should have good writing skills so that their thoughts are expressed clearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At what age should children start to read?<br>
I think children should not be forced to read too young because then they may get frustrated and not want to learn. Some children who are read to frequently in the home develop an interest in reading early, but most children are ready to start when they are in kindergarten usually by age 5. Children can learn simple characters and will soon be able to expand on that. While young children may not have the manual coordination to write characters yet, they usually take pride in identifying them. So, I think child should start to read at the age of around.</p>

<p>Where can people get more information from, words or pictures?<br>
There is a saying that “a picture can say a thousand words”. Well, I don’t believe that! While an illustration or picture can help place emphasis on what an idea is, words are much more specific and explicit in getting the information across to people. Sometimes words don’t keep the reader’s interest, so they do not grasp the main idea. But I think that if something is well written, there is less room for interpretation of what the author is trying to communicate.</p>

<p>Why do people get bored?<br>
People get bored for different reasons, some are physical and some are mental. Some people who get bored easily are people who are lacking healthy nutrition or rest. The physical part of a person certainly affects the mental and emotional parts! Other people get bored because they have been in the same daily routine for a long time, lack choices in their recreational activities, and perhaps even have a low level of mental stimulation. Many people find it hard to break out of a boring routine and try a new hobby or meet new people, even though this would provide the type of mental stimulation that would be helpful for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are people less interested in reading books nowadays?<br>
Books take a long time to read and people don’t have the time to dedicate to reading for enjoyment like they did before. Students and working adults have a lot of time commitments and less free time. Printed books seem to be replaced by ebooks because they are more convenient to have with you. If people do have an interest in books, sometimes they will listen to an audio book or ebook while they are doing something else, like working out at the gym or while they are on public transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are all the boring jobs going to be done by robots in the future?<br>
Most industries are going to become more automated in the future. People have already found robots are taking over more and more of the routine tasks that are part of a job. But it is important to realise that while many of the routine tasks are going to be done by robots, AI cannot provide the type of individual critical thinking skills required for many jobs. The question is: what is a boring job? Some people think that child care can be boring. Would a robot ever replace a human being in a nursery? I hope not! Many people in the sales field have repetitive jobs. It also can very repetitive, but they could never be replaced by a robot because of the required critical thinking skills. I think there will be jobs that will not be done by robots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people choose boring jobs?<br>
There are times when choosing a boring job is not necessarily a poor choice. Not all boring jobs are low-paying. Some people choose to do jobs they find boring because they are making enough money to make a good living and support their families. My college-aged cousin works as a landscaper during summer vacation. He doesn’t particularly like the work, but it pays well and it helps him pay for his college expenses. Others choose boring jobs because they save their energy for activities outside of their work day. My neighbour has two school aged children and she works in a retail job so she can earn a some money, but still get her kids ready for school in the morning and be home for them when they get home. It is a personal choice.</p>

<p>How should young people perform on their first jobs?<br>
It is extremely important for young people to perform well on their first jobs. It is vital to carry out all of the responsibilities of their job to the very best of their abilities! This will show they are hard-working, dedicated to the company, and eager to take on new responsibilities. They will probably need to put extra time into their jobs to learn as much as they can about the job and company. This knowledge and increased skill set will help them as they advance in their career. Doing these things will help young people perform well on their first job and will be the foundation for a good career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can people improve their job performance?<br>
As I mentioned before, it is important for people to learn all of the responsibilities of their job and to do them competently and with enthusiasm! It is important to be organised so that none of their responsibilities are overlooked which would reflect very badly on them! Putting in extra hours at the workplace will help employees develop this organisation, especially when people are just starting their job. Something else that is sometimes overlooked is the ability to get along with others. It is important to develop good relationships with supervisors and co-workers because they are excellent sources of information and help if you need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What skill set should a manager have?<br>
Managers should have a variety of skills to be successful because they need to be able to lead people to successfully complete their responsibilities in a fair and timely manner. It is a big job and in order to do this, a manager must be very observant, organised, and detailed oriented in order to meet deadlines. Managers also need to understand the job functions within the department so they can recognise if there is a problem and respond to it proactively. A manager can also look at the work flow and make suggestions to improve productivity or cost savings for the company. This is where the ability to problem-solve is very important!</p>
</li>

<p>Do you think what you have learned in university is going to help in your future job?<br>
I definitely feel what I learned in university will help me be successful in my future job. I feel fortunate that my education included many things that will help me be organised and productive. My coursework in finance and languages will certainly help me in the international business world, but the technology courses have given me a strong background to be effective in my job. This education and experience have broadened my understanding of the expectations in the workforce and I feel I am ready to be productive and successful!</p>

<p>Do people spend too much money on their birthday parties or weddings?<br>
Birthday parties and weddings are very special events and most people do spend too much money on them. On the other hand, if people want to spend an excessive amount of money on a party or wedding because it brings them joy, and they have the money to do so, they should! However, for most ordinary people, it is important not to spend more than you can afford. People should not go heavily into debt to pay for that special party because they may find they can’t do the things they want to do in the future. After all, what is more important, a wedding or a down payment on a home!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much do you think people should spend on their birthday parties or weddings?<br>
How much people should spend depends on how much money a family has saved and earns in a year. I think that people should not spend more on a birthday party than they can afford without going into any debt and with enough money left over to pay for their living expenses after! Weddings are more of an occasion than birthday parties because weddings are lifetime memories for the bride and groom and their families. However, often society puts pressure on people to have a more expensive wedding than the family can really afford.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is the better way to retain memories, by videos or photos?<br>
Both are great ways to retain memories, but I think photos are a better way to retain memories because they are more convenient to display and accessible to show others. I can frame a photo and place it on a piece of furniture. Every time I walk by it, I will remember the experience. I can make a collage of photos and place them on the wall by my front door. When people come in and see them, they will see photos of this special memory. If my friends ask about a recent event, I can show them a quick picture on my cell phone rather than expect them to politely sit through a longer video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can forgetful people remember things better?<br>
Forgetful people have to work to organise themselves to remember things. One way is to write things down on a calendar. If they use a cell phone calendar, they can set it so that it gives them audio reminders when they need to do things and for appointments! If they use a printed calendar, they have to make sure they look at it every day. Some forgetful people will use a task list where they will write down tasks that they have to do and check them off as they complete them. These can all be part of a time management system. Of course, they only work if the forgetful person remembers to do them!</p>

<p>What is the difference between face to face conversation and phone conversation?<br>
Face to face conversations are nice because you can see the person you are talking with. So much of communication is unspoken, seeing someone’s facial expressions and body language as you talk can add so much to the discussion. Phone conversations tend to be faster and are often considered more convenient for that reason. Another difference is that phone conversations seem to be getting replaced by texts. But face to face conversations seem to be getting more popular, especially with apps like WeChat where face to face conversations can occur electronically!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which one do you prefer, face to face conversation or phone conversation?<br>
I prefer face to face conversations to phone conversations. I like to see the person I am speaking with. When I ask, “How are you feeling?”, I can see with my eyes if the person is telling the truth or just being polite. It is easier to express emotions face to face. I can use facial expressions as cues whether to pursue the conversation or change the subject. By reading body language, it is easy to tell if a person is busy and only has a few minutes to talk, so there aren’t awkward delays trying to find a way to end the conversation. Also, there are far less distractions face to face, and therefore, the interaction you have is more meaningful than by phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any disadvantages of face to face conversation?<br>
There are a few disadvantages to face to face conversations. The biggest disadvantage is you must maintain your appearance for a face to face conversation! I can speak to someone on the phone while wearing my favourite fuzzy bathrobe and comfortable slippers with unbrushed hair, but that would be totally inappropriate for most, if not all, face to face conversations! Another disadvantage is if the listener is inattentive. The speaker can feel hurt that he or she is not getting the expected amount of attention. Often, then the speaker then starts into a awkward monologue until the meeting can be ended.</p>

<p>What food is popular throughout the world?<br>
I think one of the most popular foods throughout the world is eggs. Eggs are such a versatile food. They can be scrambled, fried, poached, boiled. So much can be made with them and they can be seasoned in so many ways and eaten at every meal. In France, eggs are beaten until they are very fluffy and baked to make a breakfast soufflé. In Mexico, they have a famous dessert called a flan. The eggs are lightly beaten with milk, sweetened with sugar, and baked. It tastes similar to a custard. People eat different types of eggs. While chicken eggs are the most popular, many dishes can be made out of duck eggs, quail eggs, and even ostrich eggs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people use imported products?<br>
People use imported products to supplement their own locally grown and produced products. For instance, bananas and many citrus fruits only grow in tropical climates. If you happen to live in an Arid climate, the only way to enjoy these fruits is to import them. Imported food is different from what we are used to eating and is interesting to taste. As an example, imported food products are practical if people are cooking an international cuisine when there are no substitutes locally for that ingredient, for instance, using a spice from India. Often, people will buy an imported product because it is considered “the best” from that country, for example Cuban cigars are recognised world-wide for their quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people living in different regions like different food?<br>
People grow up eating in a way similar to how their parents ate when they were growing up. Their tastes develop a liking for that kind of food from a very young age. The food most people eat is what is available locally because local food is usually fresher and less expensive. If someone is born and raised in a tropical climate, their tastes may more naturally gravitate to tropical fruits. However, if a person is born and raised in a very cold climate, the flavour of tropical fruits will seem very foreign and it will probably take some time to develop a fondness for that type of food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do different places have their own popular products?<br>
Absolutely. This is because different places have their own locally grown products that have been farmed and produced in their area for generations. The local people are very familiar with their own local products and know how to produce them in the best and most delicious ways. They just have more experience with their own local products. Once people outside of the area realise this how delicious these products are, they want these products to be available to them also!</p>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of taking photos with smartphones?<br>
It seems that everyone carries a smartphone with them all of the time, so it is very convenient to take a photo with it when a “photo opportunity” comes up! You don’t need to carry a separate camera. The photos are stored digitally on your smartphone and can easily be shared with others via social media. Most smartphones have apps which allows you to add special effects and edit right there on the phone! A disadvantage is of course, a smart phone is not as good as a camera. The photo will not look as professional as one taken with a camera. The camera has better picture quality and has manual control of features that make the photograph a better quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think photographers are artists?<br>
Some photographers are artists; others are people who like to take pictures. A true artist will take photographs that elicits an emotion from the person viewing it. Perhaps a photographer will take beautiful landscape pictures or capture feelings of the people who are subjects in the photo. Some photographers will work with special effects like filters to enhance colours which creates more interest when viewing their work. Some work with time exposures to capture the movement or growth of an object over time. These people are artists. Then there are photographers like me. I just like to take pictures for the memories and because it is fun!</p>

<p>What are the benefits of learning painting for children?<br>
Children love to paint and it can be very beneficial for them. Young children can learn their colours, basic shapes, and patterns through painting. They learn about mixing colours. It also helps them develop their fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination. As they get a bit older, they develop some decision-making skills as they decide what to paint and what colours to use for different parts of the painting. Some children are able to express their emotions through painting and use of colour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can anyone become a famous artist through hard work?<br>
No, I don’t think just anyone can become a famous artist, even with hard work. Everyone can improve on their skills through hard work to become proficient. However, a person has to be born with certain inherent abilities and then, with a lot of hard work and some luck, they might become famous. These natural abilities include an inclination to being observant, as well ability to see depth and colour nuances at a young age. Artists also have imagination and strive to have others see through their eyes. Even people who are born with these abilities still have to have the interest and determination to work to become that special artist.</p>

<p>How do advertisements influence children?<br>
Advertising has a great effect on children. On one hand, advertisements give children more opportunities to know more about the world and see many new and interesting products and innovations. These cannot be learned in schools or taught by parents. On the other hand, some advertisements may induce children, which is not conducive to children’s growth in a right way. It's terrible that a child might want to try drinking because he saw a beer advertisement. Therefore, the influence of advertising on children can be good or bad, parents should pay attention to distinguishing between the two for their children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should advertising aimed at kids be prohibited?<br>
I think that we do not need to prohibit the advertisement aimed at kids. It is too absolute, but it should be controlled and guided. From a child's point of view, children lack experience and judgment, sometimes they cannot understand the difference between TV advertisements and their favourite animated cartoons. Children's inappropriate behaviour, for example, violence, addiction to games, ignorance of teachers should not appear in advertisements. Some special advertisements, such as tobacco and alcohol, should avoid the use of children's images. As long as the guidance is strengthened, the adverse effects can be minimised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think parents should but more toys for their kids or spend more time with them?<br>
There is no doubt that parental companionship is better for children than anything else. Children are always fond of new stuff. They easily get bored with the new toys which were bought by their parents a few days earlier. Obviously, parents cannot just keep buying new toys for their children. On the contrary, only the company of parents can make the children grow up healthily. For example, playing with the same toys with their parents, children can have more fun and interest than playing alone by themselves. Besides parents can teach their children some basic principles while they are playing together. Children need to communicate with their parents and it is better than playing alone with toys only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between the toys kids play with now and those they played with in the past?<br>
Because of the underdeveloped technology, children used to play with some toys and games in the past. Boys liked to play with plastic pistols, while girls played with dolls. Or they play hide-and-seek games together. All these games and toys were free or at a low price. However, for today's children, they start to play with mobile phones and iPads when they are little. For example, toys are also electrified or can talk. They play electronic games on iPads instead of playing outdoor activities with friends. Most of their electronic games and toys are expensive. The development of science and technology makes children's toys and games more and more advanced nowadays.</p>

<p>Why do so many young people choose communication and media studies as their major?<br>
On one hand, communication and media require lower scores, which is a shortcut to a good university for many students. This means they have more opportunities to choose their favourable schools with the scores they got in the College Entrance Exam. On the other hand, many students really like this profession. They like to show themselves in front of the camera, or even work behind-the-scenes in recording or production. They want to spread what they have seen and what they have heard to other people. This helps a lot of people see the world without leaving home. I have a good friend whose major is in hosting and broadcasting. I think it's a great major.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do young people find it hard to make career choices?<br>
Most young people don't know what jobs they like or are suitable for them at the beginning. First, it is because they don’t know what their own strengths are. For example, if you know you are good at math and interested in logic and reasoning, you are sure that a math-related field will be your future career choice. Secondly, young people often lack the opportunity and confidence to try anything unknown. So, they need to take part in more internships during their college. From sophomore year, they can visit different industries and workplaces in order to see and understand what these careers are related to. This helps them to understand what exactly they will work on in the near future if they choose these careers in the real society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can affect the career choices of young people?<br>
I think there are many factors influencing the career choices of young people. First, the salary must be the most important factor. After all, the income from work directly affects people’s enthusiasm for work after entering society. Secondly, family opinions can also influence people’s choices for their careers. For example, many children want to work in the government organisations because their parents like them to have stable jobs. The third, it is personal interest. Some young people would like to choose their jobs according to their hobbies. They do not mind what salary is, they only do whatever they are fascinated in. In general, young people's career choice is a comprehensive consideration of many aspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can people have free choices of their jobs?<br>
I don't think so. In today's China, many people can't have free choices of their jobs. Most people think that government officials and teachers are the best professions in China’s job markets. Practically, people have to ensure that they earn so they can afford what they spend. Especially, to be independent for living is the priority for most of the young people after they have graduated from their university. So, they cannot choose their dream jobs only according to their interest. Besides, there are a lot of limitations when people want to choose their favourable jobs. For example, the social connections, the majors, the job opportunities and even the situation of the economy in China are all the factors they might encounter.</p>

<p>Do people have more free time than those in the past?<br>
I think with the development of society, people have less and less free time nowadays. We have a lot of new innovations and applications to learn and to use. As a student, I am aware of the stress I have at school and after school. For example, I often go to my tutorial classes in my spare time. Even if I stay in the dormitory, I have to finish the homework and projects assigned by the teacher. There is very little leisure time that I could enjoy after school. I have some friends who are three years older than me, and they already have jobs. They told me that they often work overtime, from 9am to 9 pm, and work 6 days a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the difference between the things people did in their free time in the past and the things they do nowadays??<br>
When I was little, my parents had a lot of free time because they hardly needed to work overtime. My mom used to cook for all of us every day. During week days, my parents often took me to the park for a little walk after dinner. Generally, people had a lot of free time to accompany their families or do what they liked. However, nowadays people are too busy with their work every day. They have much less free time. With more and more work load and pressure, they have to work overtime more often than before. So, they seldom cook at home, but order meals online after work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do people like to do when they are free in your country?<br>
People at different ages have different hobbies. For students, we prefer to hanging out together for shopping, eating or singing at KTV when we have free time after school. It's boring for us to stay at home in our spare time. But for those who need to go to work from 9am to 5pm, or sometimes working overtime until 9pm, they're too tired after work. For example, my sister likes to stay at home, listen to music or play games on weekends. She often refuses to go out for dinner, and orders her meals online instead. For office workers, weekends are a rare free time for them to be relaxed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think most people are able to manage their free time well?<br>
Most people can't manage their time well, so success can only belong to a few people. I think good time management can greatly improve the efficiency of work; thus people get more free time in return. For sure, this requires great self-discipline. In addition, doing exercises, reading or singing are some of the good activities for people to do at their spare time. However, many people just complain that they are too busy at work, but spend all their free time playing games on their cell phones every day and night.</p>

<p>How do Chinese people celebrate their family events? Is there anything different from other countries?<br>
Eating out and drinking are two typical and traditional ways that Chinese people celebrate our family events. Eating and drinking can satisfy all the social interaction of Chinese people, including celebration, business, dating and so on. Chinese people like drinking, but they are different from other countries. Most Westerners celebrate with red wine and beer while Chinese people like white wine. And we do not have very strict table manners. We like to sit around, chat and laugh loudly in public or at home with our families. We do enjoy the happiness and excitement sharing with our family members in this way. Compared with other countries, Chinese celebrations are very distinctive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it important for sports fans to celebrate when their favourite team wins?<br>
I think that the favourite team for sports fans is normally their own city, or country team. When their favourite team wins, the fans will have a sense of honour. This is just like the Chinese will spontaneously support the Chinese National Team. When the Chinese team defeats the teams of other countries, I will certainly be proud that I am a Chinese. Besides sports fans have their own idol players in their favourite teams. They are fascinated by the sport stars, thus they would like to celebrate with their heroes together after the games. It is the way for them to express their love and excitement with the sport stars and their favourable teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people prefer winning in a team or on their own?<br>
This varies from person to person. I think most Chinese like teamwork. In Chinese culture, cooperation has always been respected. But for me, I prefer to my personal victory. Team work is important, but good team members are not easy to find. And it takes a long time to form a well-coordinated team according to my own experience. Thus, to me, my own success can build up my leadership ability. I can be aware of my own weakness in the competition with others. This makes me better and stronger in the future competitions and challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are birthday celebrations different between young and old?<br>
Young people often value their birthdays. They like to have birthday parties with families and friends to celebrate together. They love to exchange their presents at the parties. For young people, birthdays mean growth, and they think birthdays are the milestones in their life. For the older generation, like my parents, they don't like to celebrate their birthdays. It might because they have had a lot of birthday celebrations when they were young. Now while getting older and older, they just want to forget their ages. In addition, the older generation doesn't care whether birthday gifts are expensive or not. Even if they only received a birthday card, they are very happy and satisfied.</p>

<p>What kind of film is popular?<br>
I think comedy is more and more popular in China. First of all, comedy is suitable for people of all ages to watch, especially for the whole family to watch it together on holidays. But horror movies or science fiction movies have their limitations. Secondly, a lot of people work under great pressure at work and life, nowadays. It is a good way for people to decompress by watching a comedy together on weekends. What's more, many comedies nowadays actually contain some truth and reality. People can understand what the movies and the director exactly tell them after they laugh. This makes more and more people like to watch comedy in today's China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of film do young people like to watch?<br>
I think young people would like to watch romantic movies and science fiction movies. On one hand, each boy has a science fiction dream in his mind. Normally boys have better imagination, and they like the unknown, science fiction and mechanical elements. So basically, every boy would like to watch science fiction. On the other hand, girls may like to watch romantic and family movies. Since girls are more delicate, they would like to see the family movies and romantic love movies. Mostly, they prefer to see happy endings to the movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do fewer people choose to watch movies in cinema than people did in the past?<br>
I think fewer people choose to watch movies in cinema now. First of all, that is because the home audio-visual equipment is very effective now. While the size of the TV is getting bigger and bigger, and its sound is getting better and better. The feeling and the experience of watching movies at home is getting similar with that in the cinema. In addition, many movies are now available on the Internet after they are broadcast in the cinema, and the price is not as expensive. People can choose the time for watching. So instead of going out to the cinema, people would like to relax at home and watch the movies on a sofa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think cinemas will disappear in the future?<br>
I don't think so. First, although the home audio-visual equipment is becoming more and more advanced, it is still not comparable to the professional equipment of the cinema. For example, disaster movies and science fiction movies rely heavily on 3D special effects, and the feeling and experience of watching such movies in cinemas are much better than that of watching movies at home. Secondly, when watching movies at home, people are much more likely to be interrupted. Family members or phone calls will interfere with their concentration on watching movies. And people in cinemas are relatively orderly. They are all required to turn off their mobile phones and keep quiet. In general, going to the cinema is a social activity, especially for lovers and couples.</p>

<p>Describe a leisure activity you do with your family</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What leisure activities are popular in China?<br>
There are so many leisure activities that people can enjoy in China; it’s hard to name them all. People of all ages enjoy public dancing. You don’t have to be a good dancer to join in. Dancers of all abilities are welcome. It’s a wonderful way to enjoy the music and movement with friends and to meet new people! Playing Mahjong and walking in the park are also popular activities that people young and old enjoy. Some people enjoy keeping pets and will walk them in the park. None of these activities necessarily cost a lot money, but they bring people together so they can unwind from their stress while enjoying good company of others and being outdoors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What leisure activities do young people like?<br>
Young people tend to like more active leisure activities. Public dancing is active and certainly is popular, but so are activities like badminton and table tennis. There are plenty of opportunities to play in the park, but also at the local community center or in recreational leagues. There are always people available to play! Young people also like to go out with small groups of friends to do KTV on weekend evenings. It is a fun way to unwind after a long week of work or classes. Video games are also popular with young people, and while it isn’t very active, many find it a way to escape from daily pressures. I think video games are popular because if someone is in the mood to be alone or doesn’t have a lot of time, playing a video game for 30 minutes can be a good way to relax.</p>
</li>

<p>Do leisure activities have to be educational?<br>
Leisure activities don’t have to be educational, but they can be. My brother belongs to a chess club and he certainly has learned more about strategy and competition from being part of that. But I think that enjoying leisure activities benefits people in other ways that are equally important. Walking and dancing are great ways for people of all ages to be physically active which is good for their health, helps relieve stress, and improves the overall well-being of each individual because it keeps people socially active. Playing mahjong keeps people mentally engaged and socially active which is also good for people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do men and women like different leisure activities?<br>
Men and women can enjoy the same leisure activities, but often they have others that they prefer on their own. Both men and women seem to equally enjoy activities like public dancing, walking in the park, KTV, badminton, etc. But when I am in the park, I notice more men play jianzi than women. On the other hand, it seems more women enjoy doing some hand crafts like knitting, making lace, or candle making. That doesn’t mean that both men and women can’t enjoy the same activities, but it seems that sometimes they have less interest.</p>

<p>What indoor games do children like to play nowadays?<br>
Children seem to be spending a lot of time playing computer games indoors; there are even computer games designed for very young children! I think more and more computer games are considered educational and children have fun while they learn. However, children like to do activities like paint and draw inside too! They can spend hours playing with puzzles, tangrams, and building structures with building blocks like Legos when they are alone. However, kids still enjoy have a friend over and will play card games or even board games like checkers or mancala while they enjoy each other’s company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What qualities should a team leader have?<br>
A team leader has to be dedicated to the team goal, be able to communicate well with others, and most of all, have integrity. The team’s goals may change over time. It may be more reasonable for a team to have a smaller goal that needs to be achieved in order to reach a higher goal. The team leader has to believe in those goals and communicate them with enthusiasm and by encouraging each individual on the team. Further, the team leader has to have integrity and follow rules themselves while treating everyone else with equal fairness. These qualities will make others want to follow the team leader!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is teamwork important to individuals?<br>
Teamwork is a very important skill for individuals to learn and apply in their lives. Businesses are looking for employees who can work with others to solve problems. Everyone has a different strength. If you put different strengths together, you have a stronger team than if you are working alone. With cooperation between team members, they can solve challenges with more efficiency and confidence! Often, individuals think that their solution is the only solution, and perhaps it is. But if individuals communicate openly and listen to each other, they may find that there are other things that can be added to the original idea that will improve it. Then the team can share responsibilities to divide the workload and make it more achievable in a shorter period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think of people spending too much time playing computer games?<br>
I think spending too much time playing computer games is a waste of what could otherwise be productive time! I am not saying that playing computer games to relax is a bad thing, but the time has to be monitored. Nothing of real value is achieved by playing five hours of computer games. What could people do with four of those five hours that might be better for them mentally or physically? Perhaps they could be outside hiking which is better for their physical well-being. Maybe they could be meeting with friends and enjoy the social interaction. Perhaps they could be helping a neighbour, which is a satisfying thing to do and good for the community! So many choices for people unless they waste that time!</p>

<h1 id="no-23-骗朋友的经历">No. 23 骗朋友的经历</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why do people lie sometimes?<br>
Most people are good, but sometimes good people lie. Usually, they lie because telling the truth would somehow hurt themselves or hurt someone else. Sometimes people lie because they don’t want to take responsibility for something that went wrong or to embarrass themselves. Occasionally, people would rather lie than to admit they don’t know the answer to a question. A “lie of omission” is not telling the whole truth. For example, telling your parents you walked your younger brother home from school, but not mentioning you stopped to buy ice cream cones along the way! I think the most common type of lie is the “white lie” when you don’t want to hurt someone else’s feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you define white lies?<br>
Like I mentioned, white lies are things people say when they don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings. Generally, white lies usually are told to be polite and are about topics that aren’t very important. Here’s an example. My friend was very proud of her new short, spikey haircut. I thought it looked like she had a sea urchin on her head! When she asked me directly how I liked it, I said, “It’s cute. I’ll bet it’ll be cool in the summer.” This lie fits the definition because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, I wanted to be polite, and frankly, how I really feel about her hairstyle isn’t important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it’s important to teach children to be honest?<br>
Definitely! Children need to learn that if they are honest, people know they are trustworthy. If they make a mistake or a bad choice and if they are honest about it, people will respect their honesty. If they lie about a mistake, no one will trust anything they say. It’ll take a long time before people will see them as trustworthy again. Even though I think it is very important to teach children to be honest, it’s also important to teach them to be polite and have manners. So, children also need to learn that telling white lies to be polite is not being dishonest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are other ways to teach children about honesty except having parents or teachers teach them?<br>
I think the parents and teachers are the primary influences to teach children about honesty, but there are other ways to reinforce this important lesson. There are many children’s book that address honesty. Nothing is better than to read a story when the main character makes a poor choice and then deals with the consequences of being dishonest with others. Perhaps asking a grandparent, or another trusted adult, to tell a family story about honesty in front of the child. This may lead to a discussion around the importance of being honest. I think the best way for children to learn is for the child to see other people around them being honest and truthful. They will want to model that behaviour.</p>

<p>What things do people often lose?<br>
People often lose small things, especially when they are in a hurry. They are usually things that they carry or use with their hands frequently. I think the most common items are keys, cell phones, purses, and gloves. This is because people use them and put them down. When they are leaving, they forget to pick them back up again before they go! Or sometimes people quickly toss things into their pockets and the items fall as they are walking. When I was little, I would wear mittens in the winter. I would put them in my pocket while I was playing, one of them would always fall out. I knew I had to stop playing five minutes early so I could look for it before I went home!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do people find the things that they lose?<br>
The easiest way is to re-trace your steps. That means, you think of the last time you saw it or used it, and then go everywhere you went after that! For instance, if I couldn’t find my cell phone in my house, I would think, “When was the last time I used it?” If I remembered that I texted a friend from my bedroom, I would go there and look. If I didn’t find it there, I would go to the next place I went after my bedroom until I would eventually find it. My mother has a device on her key chain so she can locate it with her cell phone. It has helped her a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you do to prevent from losing things?<br>
I try to put things in the same place, then I know where to look for things! For instance, when I come home, I put my keys on a hook by the door. It is a habit, everyone in the family does it. Also, I have a purse with a zipper on the top.If I use my cellphone when I am out, I put it back in my purse and zip it up so it stays with me. And a lesson I learned from losing many, many mittens is only putting my gloves in a deep coat pocket so they don’t fall out. Most importantly, I remember to look around me whenever I leave places so I don’t forget an item there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you do when you found the things that others have lost<br>
If I know who lost the item, I immediately text or call them so they don’t worry. Then we arrange for how they will get it back. If I don’t know who lost it, I think it depends on how valuable the item is. Once I found a ring on a bus. I knew it was valuable, so I posted an advertisement on the internet asking for owner to identify the engraving on the inside. The woman contacted me right away and was thrilled to get it back! If it isn’t as valuable as that, like a hat or umbrella, I would turn it in to the driver for the lost and found. That way the owner could retrace their steps and check with the bus to get their item back.</p>

<li>
<p>Are modern people happier than those who lived in the past?<br>
I think people living in the past were happier than those in the modern society. Back in the days, people really loved to communicate with each other face to face. They shared their happiness and excitement with each other more often by holding parties, celebrations and playing sports. And people also enjoyed shopping in the stores or malls during their weekends and holidays. However now, with the rapid growth of high technologies, people mainly communicate with each other and shop online. They have less opportunities for hanging out with friends, shopping in the stores with families, and meeting up with each other in person. More and more young people stay alone at home and chat only online with friends by typing on their cell phones or keyboards. They live in a virtual world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you like to have celebrations with? Friends or family?<br>
I would like to have celebrations with my family rather than friends. No matter what happens in my life, the people who stand by me and support me will always be my family. My parents encourage me when I am not confident in my studies or making new friends in school. So, whenever I have any celebrations, I would first like to thank my family for their support and encouragement. In my opinion, visiting with my friends is mainly about talking about fun and entertainment. Being with family means much more. You get to release the stress that’s been building in you, and tell your family what you are really feeling inside. You don’t have to hide any unhappiness or any ideas from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can money make people happy?<br>
Money plays an important role in people’s lives. We need enough money not only to make our daily living such as food, clothing, utilities, but also need money to pay for our entertainment. In this way, we have a better quality of life. And people obtain happiness through enjoying high quality of life. However, the happiness that money can bring is limited to certain level. Money will bring more trouble instead of happiness after a certain level. Psychological happiness can’t be obtained by money. Money does buy things that can make life easier and more comfortable, but if all someone loves is money, then they are greedy and their lives are always focused on making more money. By doing this, they miss the things that money cannot buy--like time with people you love, enjoying the cultural things around us, enjoying time doing hobbies that don’t revolve around making money. I think there has to be a balance to have a happy life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are some people unhappy nowadays?<br>
Today, with the improvement of social productive forces, people's material and spiritual needs are constantly changing. On the contrary, competition and challenges force people to give up their mental lives, but desperately work for their jobs, houses, and cost of living. This is the negative impact of materialism on the development of modern society. This makes some people feel more and more lonely and empty. Money, fame, and wealth are the factors which make some people feel like the barriers in their spiritual lives nowadays. So, the more they ask for, the less happiness they feel. With social economic development and improvement of people's living standards, people feel more and more spiritually lonely and depressed.</p>

<li>
<p>Which is more important? Preserving old buildings or building new ones?<br>
In my opinion, I think that preserving old buildings is much more important than building new ones. Most important is that it is crucial to retaining our nation’s heritage and history. If we demolish old buildings, the history will be lost. But, by restoring old buildings, people will be reminded of the history and it can be handed down to younger generations. Also important is the environmental impact. It is more practical to preserve older buildings because there is a large cost involved in demolishing them. Plus, the rubble will need to be recycled appropriately; and it reduces the need for as many new materials to rebuild it. There are many advantages to preserving older buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of old buildings do people like to visit in China?<br>
People like to visit older buildings with exceptional architecture that have been refurbished so their history remains intact, but with updated safety features like updated electrical wiring and structural repairs. Also, visiting a historical building that has been repurposed makes it interesting and practical. For instance, there is a building that had been used as a school at the turn of the last century a few blocks away from my home. When it was no longer able to accommodate the number of students, it was renovated to become a local community library. The outside architecture remained the same, but it was redesigned inside to include more natural lighting, places for books, computer labs, as well as cozy and quiet study areas. It’s a pleasure to go into the building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the most important to a public building? Design, location or facilities?<br>
While all three things are very important, without a question, the most critical thing is the facilities. The facilities represent and meet the needs of the community around it. A building can have a stunning design, but if no one needs the facilities and services provided within the building, no one will have a reason to go there. Location is also important, but if the facilities are in high demand by the neighbourhood, people would be happy to take a little more time to get to it to be able to use it as long as it isn’t too far out of the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think the appearance of a building is important?<br>
The outside appearance of a building is very important. It makes a significant statement about its purpose and what is inside. The entrance should be inviting, well lit, and easy to access. It should complement the structures around it. Having an attractive public building in the community gives the local people a sense of pride. People are happier. An attractive building is more appealing for local people to want to go there and to use it, so it may become more of a meeting place. Wouldn’t you rather go to an attractive building than an ugly one?</p>

<p>Should parents help their kids with their homework?<br>
Yes, I think parents should help their kids with their homework, especially if their kids are struggling to understand how to do it. I am not saying that parents should do the homework, but if parents help their child understand the homework, the child can go into school the next day feeling more confident. Also, some kids don’t want to do homework and having a parent present, if they are helping or not, will encourage them to work on it. This is a good way for parents to support a child’s education!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of advice should parents give to their children?<br>
Parents should give all kinds of advice to their children. Parents will always have their child’s best interest in mind when they give advice. Advice about values, moral decisions, friendship issues, school and career choices are all appropriate. Sometimes the best advice is to tell a child where to go for advice! I once had an issue that I shared with my mother and she was very honest when she said she couldn’t help me, but suggested I speak with my Aunt who knew more about the subject. Parents are a good resource for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should parents give children advice? Why?<br>
Without question, yes! It is important for parents to give advice to their children because they always want what is best for their children and want them to be successful. They have experience in the situations and decisions that their children need advice in. Parents can help their children thoroughly consider options when make choices so they do not make poor decisions. Parents don’t want their children to make decisions that can potentially cause hardship and will take time and effort to correct. It is so important that children go to their parents for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can kid provide any help to parents?<br>
Absolutely! Children are exposed to many new technologies and apps that they learn through school and their peers that can make their parents’ lives easier. Children can teach their parents about technology related things like new communication apps, good resources to find informational videos, and how to make online purchases more safely. Another way children can help their parents is by providing a new perspective on current issues that they may have learned about in school. Discussions between parents and their children can sometimes help parents see another side of an issue that they may not have thought about before.</p>

<p>What do you think is the best age children to go to school?<br>
I think 5 years old is a good age to start school. At five years old, children are comfortable being away from their parents in a secure setting and they want to be with children their own age. Children are able to sit and pay attention for longer periods of time at this age. The also have developed eye hand coordination so they would be able to start to learn how to write. I think most importantly, children are curious at this age and it is a perfect time for them to start to learn how to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer to study by yourself or with friends?<br>
I definitely prefer to study by myself. It takes me much longer to get my studying done when I study with my friends. Unfortunately, I am very easily distracted. Even if my friends don’t purposely distract me, even if they stand up or shift position, I look up. And if a friend wants to take a break for something to eat, I can never refuse! I prefer to find a quiet corner in the library, put my ear buds in, and study alone. That way I won’t even be distracted by friends or people walking by.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What quality do you think a good teacher should have?<br>
A good teacher should have in-depth knowledge of the subject he or she is teaching, as well as strong enthusiasm for the topic. Teachers who are enthusiastic about their subject present the information in a more interesting ways. They go into more depth and share additional facts because they know more about the subject. This encourages students to want to learn. My favourite classes have always been with teachers who are excited to share their enthusiasm for their subject. This enthusiasm becomes contagious because everyone in the class becomes excited by the subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you think can learn better, old people or youngster?<br>
I think young people have the advantage on learning new material. Often old people are not interested in learning new things unless it specifically relates to something they need to know. They may be set in their ways and be resistant to learn new concepts or ideas. Young people tend to have a broader interest base and are more curious about things, even if it doesn’t relate to something specific. Young people have also been learning regularly in school. It is a skill that they have been practicing currently. Older people have not been engaged in the learning process for many years!</p>

<p>Does weather have any impact on people’s daily activities?<br>
Weather has a very important impact on people’s daily activities. To begin with, the weather influences what clothing a person will wear for the day. If it is cold and snowing, people will choose much different clothing than if it is warm and sunny! People plan their outdoor activities around the weather. You will see more people outside in the park exercising, dancing, and even just socialising if the weather is pleasant. If it is raining or cold, more people will stay inside and plan indoor activities instead. Sudden inclement weather also forces people to change their scheduled activities at the last minute, for instance if there is a sudden rain storm, people might prefer to postpone a picnic until the sunshine returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people do different kinds of sports in different weather?<br>
Sports are usually played in certain seasons. This is because that season’s weather provides the best conditions to play the sport making it easier for the participants. Winter sports like skiing, snowboarding, figure skating, ice hockey, and sledding are best done when the natural weather is cold to provide the necessary snow and ice. Warm summer temperatures make water sports like swimming, diving, and surfing much more practical to do. The sports that generally involve a lot of running like soccer and field hockey are often played in the Spring or Fall because players aren’t dealing with extreme heat or cold and the playing fields are able to be maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of weather do Chinese people like?<br>
Chinese people like sunny, temperate weather. Weather that is not too hot and not too cold is perfect for just about any outdoor activity. And, sunshine brightens everyone’s attitude and is very welcome for people who may have been indoor at work or at school for several hours. Some Chinese people enjoy warmer weather common in the south or cooler in the north, but everyone enjoys the sunshine. Very few people enjoy the rainy season and no one enjoys the typhoons or severe snow storms which can create damage with unsafe conditions and disrupt everyday activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people talk about weather when they meet for the first time?<br>
Weather is something that everyone experiences together, so it is a popular topic that everyone has common knowledge about. Since, everyone experiences the weather in a common way, it is a way for people to start a conversation, especially when they don’t know what else they may have in common yet. Also, the conversations generally start in agreement, “Isn’t this weather beautiful?” This topic can encourage people to start to talk and speak politely with each other because the weather generally isn’t controversial. It is a good way to begin a discussion so people can get to know each other.</p>

<p>Why are people living in a community friendly with others?<br>
A community is a group of people who live near each other so it makes sense that they are friendly with each other. They see each other frequently, if not daily. Since they see each other so frequently, they tend to become friends, not just be friendly. They learn about each other’s families. They look after each other. Often when a member of the community is sick, others in the community will offer to help by bringing over food or help with childcare and errands. People will also celebrate life milestones together, like graduations or birthdays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are popular activities in a community?<br>
People who live in a community often share hobbies and do activities together. It is convenient to meet with people who live near you. Often people will meet at the community centre to play mahjong, ping pong or practice calligraphy. Since children will often know each other from the community or school, they will play together or meet in the park to play sports. People young and old enjoy meeting at the park and do Tai Chi or dancing. The nice thing about living in a community is there is always someone nearby who shares a common interest!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people like living in a community?<br>
Most people like living in a community. Usually, everything people need can be found within the community, e.g. access to public transportation, shopping, restaurants, etc. Not all people are friendly and outgoing, but everyone is courteous because they see each other regularly. Living near each other provides a multi-generational support system where people look after each other because they know each other and know if someone needs help. This is especially important when parents or children may not live locally. The best thing is people can always find someone with common interests, so no one needs to feel alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do people in the community usually have social gatherings?<br>
People can have small social gatherings at their homes or in a meeting room at their apartment building. Larger social gatherings are usually held at the community centre or in the park. The local community centre has several rooms available for meeting. Some of the rooms are set up for specific activities like mahjong, but other rooms are larger for less structured gatherings. Our community centre also has a gymnasium for people to exercise or play games like ping pong or basketball together. For very large gatherings, the park is perfect. People gather to dance, do Tai Chi, or even just enjoy being outside together.</p>

<p>What can governments do to improve people’s health?<br>
The government can do a lot of things to improve people’s health. They can provide educational public programs to encourage vaccinations against disease, healthy eating, and for people of all ages to be active. They also can create and enforce regulations to improve air quality, water quality, and other environmental concerns like mandatory recycling and deforestation. However, I think along with physical health, the government can be proactive with the mental health issues by encouraging elders to remain social and for communities to look in on elders and others who may suffer from isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What activities can schools organise for children to keep fit?<br>
Some schools already have structured exercise programs during the school day so children can be active and get some fresh air. Sometimes they will do calisthenics or play games. But I think schools could also include a course in healthy eating, stress reduction, and exercise into their curriculum. While I think this would be a good<br>
start, I also think having organised after-school programs offering a variety of sports or activities that children can try would also be beneficial. If kids like one, they will want to continue being active on their own!</p>

<p>How can you tell whether a website is reliable or not?<br>
If you look at the website, you can look to make sure the information is current, that it lists the author and that the author is qualified to write on the topic. Also, notice if the website is based on facts and not opinion, and if the purpose of the website is to inform others of facts and not to sell products or influence opinions. Another way is you can check information from the website is by going on a factchecking website. These websites ask questions to determine whether the information is correct or not. The results are then calculated and the website tells you whether your information is correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people are healthier now than in the past?<br>
Yes, people are healthier than they were in the past. People are living longer and are active later in their lives. I think it is because there have been many advances in science and medicine so people are making better choices in their own health. People are being vaccinated against diseases. There is a broader variety of foods available to eat and scientific research to help people know what foods to eat and, which ones to avoid, to improve their immune systems. People understand that stress reduction and enough sleep are important to a healthy immune system. People are definitely healthier.</p>

<p>Which do you think is more important; individual development or team’s goals?<br>
I think a team’s goals are more important and that people should design their own individual development plan based on the needs of their team. For instance, if my soccer team felt it was important to develop a stronger offences and the coaches felt the best way to do that was for players to improve their ball passing, I would be working hard practicing my speed and ball passing. If every individual works towards their team’s goals to the best of their ability, both the team and the individual will benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is good thing to have disagreements within a team?<br>
I think it is important to allow for disagreements within a team because differences will naturally occur within any group. Each person should have the right to voice their opinions and frustrations, but it has to be done in a constructive way, not a destructive way. If people are able to calmly discuss their differences, they will be able to find ways to compromise to resolve the problem. This way negative feelings don’t fester and get worse so that they start to affect the team’s performance. Once the problems are resolved, everyone’s attitude will improve and they will work better as a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is good for kids to join a team?<br>
When kids are young, they only think about their themselves, which is natural. This is why kids should be encouraged to join teams. When kids join a team, kids develop discipline, they learn to play by rules, and how to set personal goals for improvement. Most importantly, they learn to work together towards a common goal. There are many important life skills that can learned by being part of a team. These are skills that kids can use as they grow older in both school and later, in their careers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can a person become a good member of a team in the workplace?<br>
People have to work together in the workplace and be a good member of their team. It begins with people doing their own job in a timely manner and meeting deadlines. It also includes following the rules of the company like arriving on time and being prepared to work. It is important to have respect for your supervisors by working hard and respect for your co-workers by being courteous and offering help if needed. I think the most important way to be a good team member is to have a good attitude by taking pride in the company and have a willingness to learn more.</p>

<p>How do you like taking care of animals?<br>
Personally, I like animals, but I don’t particularly like to take care of them. If I had more time maybe I would enjoy it. But I am so busy with my studies and activities, I think it would become stressful. I take care of my neighbour’s cat when the family goes away. He’s a great cat and I don’t mind brushing him, but cleaning his litter box is unpleasant. I do have a pet fish that I like to take care of, but it doesn’t require a lot of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is safe for animals to live in the cities?<br>
It is only safe for animals if their owners take full responsibility for them. This especially means that animals need to be kept on a leash or in a fenced area when they are outside of their owner’s home. If they get loose, they can easily get disorientated by the amount of people and traffic in the city. They could get lost and then get hit by a car or die from hunger and adverse weather! People should not have animals as pets unless they can keep them safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the problems keeping pets will bring?<br>
Most of the problems are for the pet owner. The responsible pet owner should make sure that the pet is fed, properly groomed, is vaccinated against disease, and cannot run away. The more common problems tend to be making sure the pet has enough exercise, which means taking the pet for walks in the park on a regular basis. Also, to clean up after the pet when they ‘do their business’ during these walks. It is unhygienic and unhealthy for the entire community if animal feces is left on sidewalks or in the park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are pets different now than in the past?<br>
Pets in the past had more of a purpose to the family. Perhaps they were kept so they could herd other animals or act as a guard dog for protection, etc. Now pets are kept as companions and are often viewed as members of the household. They are often pampered and treated almost like they are part of the family. As I go over to my friends’ houses, I see their pets sitting on the furniture wearing very fancy collars. I laugh when I see them feed them food from their own plates. These pets are very spoiled and serve no purpose other than to entertain their owners!</p>

<p>Why should students wear school uniforms?<br>
I think it is a good thing for students to wear school uniforms because uniforms ensure that all the students look tidy and respectable. Wearing a school uniform teaches children to take pride in a serious appearance and teaches them valuable discipline skills. Therefore, a school uniform is not just an aesthetic decision, but one that improves the overall education of the students as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On what occasions should people wear uniforms?<br>
At school, students usually have both formal and everyday uniforms. Students will wear their formal uniforms to start the week on Mondays and on special school occasions like ceremonies. It is nice to wear uniforms for special occasions as a sign of respect. Many employers require their workers to wear uniforms daily when at work so people will be able to recognise their company by their colours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should companies ask for employees’ opinions about the design of uniforms?<br>
Frankly, I think they should because if the uniform is inadvertently designed without considering the employees’ responsibilities, the uniform could be a hindrance to their doing their job well. In a restaurant, would it make sense for a waitress or chef to wear high heels when they are constantly on their feet? Or for someone to wear long sleeves when they work in heated conditions? Yes, the uniforms may look nice, but they may not be practical. While I think management would be very thoughtful about the design process, it is good to have employees feel good about giving their opinions as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can people tell a person’s personality by his/her clothes?<br>
A person’s clothes can tell a lot about a person’s personality. If a person wears clothes with bright colours and flamboyant patterns, this person is probably very outgoing, wants to be noticed, and wants to be seen as an individual. People who wear mostly dark colours, are seen as conservative and more serious. People who take time to coordinate their outfits and wear clean, well pressed clothes are seen as people who care about their appearance and want to make a good first impression when they meet others. Clothes definitely make a statement about the person who is wearing them!</p>

<p>What kinds of products do young people think are useful but old people may not?<br>
I think young people think having and using the latest technology is more important than older people. For example, young people want the latest cell phones, but older people are happy with the older models because they do not feel they need the newer features. They just want basic features like having the ability to talk and text. They don’t want the upgraded cameras with special effects. Young people also want and need the latest technology on their computers like faster processors and increased battery life. Older people are used to their computers, and therefore, are more likely to wait to upgrade until they have to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think product instructions are useful for users to use products better?<br>
All products should have product instructions because they contain very valuable information for the product users. Sometimes the product instructions are very lengthy and many users don’t take the time to read the instructions. If they don’t read them, users may not know all of the features of their product and will not use it to its full capacity. The instructions also include warrantee information, troubleshooting information for common problems, and how to maintain the product. These are all very valuable things for the user to become familiar with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you usually do if you don’t know how to use the things you have bought?<br>
If I don’t know how to use something I bought, I start looking for help by reading through the instructions. If that does not help, I will look online for a video. Often, I can find several videos that will not only show how to use the product, but also give useful shortcuts from experienced users. Sometimes it is easier for me to learn from a video than reading the instructions. If neither the instructions nor videos teach me what I need to know, I will ask my friends to see if any of them own the product and can teach me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is necessary to produce many new products nowadays?<br>
I don’t think it is necessary to produce many new products because there is already an abundance of products available for people to buy. It just seems excessive to me. However, I think it is important to produce new innovative products. If a new product is truly innovative, it will fill a need that the people have and will be useful and welcomed. This innovation also encourages more development. Producing many new products just to have more products to sell is wasteful, but producing new innovative products is good for society.</p>

<p>Do you think parents should give kids challenges?<br>
Parents should give their kids age appropriate challenges because it is good for the children for many reasons. Children will learn critical thinking skills as they work through these challenges. If they have a problem with the challenge, their parents will be there to advise them and give suggestions. It is important for children to know that it is good to ask for advice from their parents. Finally, children will feel good when they are able to complete the challenge and will feel proud that they could please their parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What challenges do you think children might have to face up to?<br>
I think challenges change depending on what age they are. Young children who are three or four face the challenge of being able to entertain themselves for short periods of time. Children five or six are challenged by attending school for the first time and learning how to behave in a classroom and with a group of peers. As they grow, they face challenges like learning new social skills: how to be a good friend, how to work as part of the team, and in this age of social media, how to deal with cyberbullying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the most challenging thing for kids?<br>
The most challenging thing that kids have to learn is time management. If children can start to learn basic time management skills at a young age, it will help them as they get older and need to spend more and more time studying. Good time management helps students get better grades and reduces stress as they take on more responsibilities. Even though parents and teachers can tell children on good ways to manage time, it is up to the child to decide to do it. Only then, will children realise that it will help them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can parents reduce the challenges that kids have? why?<br>
The best way parents can reduce the challenges that kids have is to give them advice when they need it. Kids have to go through these challenges themselves. However, parents can help guide them so they do not feel additional stress or waste time by making unnecessary mistakes. It is important that parents have a good relationship with their children so that advice can be given and asked for without any resentment.</p>

<p>What kind of people do you usually see in the news?<br>
The news programs on TV usually have many different kinds of people. Certain kinds are seen repeatedly like politicians, sports athletes, celebrities, and entertainers. These are people that everyone recognises. Other kinds of people appear only once when the news has feature stories, like interviews with people who have survived fires or natural disasters or when they show pictures of missing people. My favourite stories are uplifting stories that include interviews with people who are doing good things for the community. These survivors, missing persons, and community volunteers are not people everyone would know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are stories about celebrities in the news always true?<br>
People have to be careful what they believe when they read stories about celebrities. I think some of the stories are true, but many are not. There is a lot of pressure for celebrities to be perfect all of the time and they have very little privacy. Photographers will follow them hoping to get an unflattering picture and make up a false story to go with the picture. This can be damaging to their career. Also, sometimes celebrities will stage a story for positive publicity. They will do something nice for others after they arrange for many people to be there to see it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is news often about famous people? Why?<br>
Famous people are often in the news because people are interested in knowing everything about them! People recognise these famous people and many identify with them; they want to dress like them and act like them. Since people are interested, news reporters want to write as many stories about famous people as they can. Because of this, even things that are not very important will be on the news. I recently saw a story about the clothes a celebrity was wearing when he brought his child to her first day of school. This wouldn’t be interesting if it were about anyone else but a celebrity!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could a superstar be a positive influence to the public?<br>
Superstars can be very influential and really help society because people want to be like them and share their values. Some celebrities support major social issues by donating their talent, time, and money. This often happens after a natural disaster so that the profits of one of their shows go to the people who are affected. Pop musicians may give a special concert and donate the profits. This not only provides money, but also draws attention to the need to support others after this disaster. Other celebrities are very vocal about social messages, like the importance of being drug-free and bringing awareness to the cyber-bullying problem.</p>

<p>What kinds of job do young people prefer?<br>
Most young people prefer office jobs in the city. It is an opportunity for young people to use their education in their jobs. It is mental work, so it would be challenging and mentally stimulating, and it could lead to advancement in their career if they do well. Also, the working conditions are good. The work would be indoors so there is heat and air conditioning, so employees are comfortable with the temperature. Generally, larger companies in the city also have programs and benefits for employees that make working there even more desirable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you prefer, physical work or mental work?<br>
I am not very strong, so I prefer mental work. Additionally, I think physical work may become too repetitive and I may get bored. But I find it stimulating and exciting when I have a task or problem that requires me to think hard and come up with a solution. I find mental work to be very rewarding and it fills me with good emotions. In contrast, I find physical work tiring and I am not very good at it. To be honest, I try to avoid as much physical work as I can!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What factors should people take into consideration when choosing jobs?<br>
There are so many factors people need to think about when they are choosing a job. To start with, is the person qualified to do it? It would be very bad to take a job and then be fired for incompetence! Another consideration is if the salary will be enough to live on, although someone might consider a job with less pay because they see a lot of advancement potential in the company. Other things to consider include how long is the commute time and what are the benefits that the company offers? For example, does the company provide training or additional education? Finally, will you enjoy the job?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people nowadays like to leave their hometown to work in other cities? Why?<br>
People like to leave their hometown to work in other cities for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is because they have gone to a university in a different city and their business contacts to find a job are in that city. Also, some young people feel it is part of growing up and living on their own. It shows they are truly independent from their parents. However, often it is because young people want to move and see another part of the country. Some people are just adventurous and want to experience a change.</p>

<p>What personal events do people usually celebrate?<br>
People like to celebrate special events starting from the birth of a baby and birthdays, to life milestones like graduations, weddings, and anniversaries. When my cousin accepted a job in another city, the family gave him a big “going-away” party. We weren’t celebrating his leaving us because we were going to miss him, but we wanted him to know that we were happy for him and his new career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do people celebrate their personal events?<br>
Most people I know celebrate with parties with their family and friends. Personally, I like big parties with many people, but some people prefer a smaller gathering of family and friends. Basic celebrations can be held at home or in restaurants and usually include food, drinks, and my favourite, cake and sweets! Big events, like weddings, are much more elaborate and expensive. At these events, there will be many choices of luxurious food available, music and entertainment, and it will be held at a special venue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much time do people need to prepare for celebration?<br>
For basic celebrations, like small birthday parties, sometimes people only have to plan for a few weeks to a month. That is enough time to make reservations at a restaurant or meeting space, invite people who would like to attend, and buy a gift. However, for major events, like a wedding or 50th wedding anniversary, it could take a year or more to make arrangements because there are so many more details than a basic celebration. And people need the additional time to save money so they can pay for everything!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is necessary to spend some money on celebrations?<br>
I think it is important to spend some money on celebrations, even if it is a small amount to make that day different from every other day. That’s what makes it a celebration. My mother wanted to celebrate her 40th birthday with just her immediate family having a picnic in the country. The small amount of extra money that we spent was on preparing special foods for the picnic. buying her favourite cake for dessert, along with the transportation costs to get to the picnic site. It wasn’t a lot of money, but it was the kind of celebration that she wanted and we wanted her to be happy!</p>

<p>What skills are important to be successful in business?<br>
People who are successful in business need to be hardworking, dedicated to their company, and able to communicate well with others. To be hardworking means to be punctual, have a good work attitude, get work done within required deadlines, and be willing to help colleagues in order for the company’s goals to be met! People who are dedicated to their company will be respectful of the rules of the company, as well as be respectful of their supervisors and their coworkers. Finally, the ability to communicate problems and solutions in writing and verbally is very important in today’s business world!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the differences between required skills in the past and those at present?<br>
Communication has always been important in business. However, in today’s business world, the ability to communicate with technology is very important. It allows customers to ask questions with a text or email and they expect a response very quickly! That is why the ability to use technology is so important. Now, people don’t have to dig through stacks of paper in file cabinets to find information about products, orders, and shipments. People who can learn technology and their company’s computer system, can find answers quickly with just a few keystrokes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of skills should successful people have?<br>
In addition to the skills I have already mentioned, I think successful people should also know how to identify problems quickly, analyse these problems for possible solutions, and choose the best solution. Problems always come up unexpectedly, but a successful person will have an idea when something isn’t going smoothly. Identifying potential problems early is a valuable skill. Going further from identifying the problem to actually solving the problem and implementing the solution will help people be successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think teamwork and communication skills are important? Why?<br>
Teamwork and communication skills are very important in today’s businesses! When it comes to problem solving, often people in a department will work together as a team. Everyone brings different strengths to the team and, hopefully, they will be able to communicate their ideas to the group so that the group can fully analyze the problem and then decide on the best solution. A person can be a genius, but if he or she cannot communicate ideas verbally when working in a team, it doesn’t help the team solve the problem! Others may find a person who cannot communicate well difficult to work with.</p>

<p>Where do people in China like to live, in a house or an apartment?<br>
Many people in China prefer to live in an apartment in the city. Apartment buildings usually have facilities that everyone can use. It is easy to get to know your neighbours and it promotes a sense of community. Also, these buildings are usually close to things people need like places to shop, parks, and public transportation so that commuting is easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the benefits of living in a house?<br>
There is much more privacy from your neighbours if you live in a house. It will be quieter because you will not hear anyone in the hall or dogs barking next door. You can be louder too, because you won’t disturb people who live around you! Another advantage is that there aren’t any rules about what you can and cannot do in the building. Some apartment buildings have rules like restricting the number of pets residents can own or their size. There are no restrictions when you live in a house and have your own yard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do many people like to live, in the city centre or the suburbs?<br>
The city centre is the a very popular place to live. It can be more expensive, but there are so many more things to do than in the suburbs. And most of these things are within walking distance! There are many more high-quality restaurants and places for entertainment and recreation. Also, people often work in the city centre so it is easier and quicker to get to their office. This is more time for people to spend with their families rather than commuting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do many people like to live in the city?<br>
I think the main reason is because there is so much to do in the city. So many good places to eat and be entertained! People often work in the city and there are many good schools are located there. So, living in the city means less time commuting to work and to school. There is no need for a car because if places you want to go are not within walking distance, you can get there very quickly through public transportation.</p>

<p>What is the difference between watching performance live and watching it on TV?<br>
There are advantages to both. If you are watching something on TV, you can “pause” it while you get something to eat and not miss any part of it or even record it and watch it again later. You can also be very comfortable lounging on a couch or chair. However, live performances are always so more enjoyable in person. It is fun to be part of the audience as everyone is waiting with eager anticipation for the performance to start. The lights, sounds, and audience add so much more to the performance. Watching it live is much more of an experience than watching it on TV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you prefer? Traditional performance or concert?<br>
I like concerts. The bands I like to see usually have exciting light shows as part of the concert. I like to hear the songs I enjoy so much being performed live and to see the groups sing them on stage. The singers will show their personalities by encouraging the audience to clap or sing lyrics that we all know. The music is loud and sometimes I think I can feel the music vibrate through me as well as hear it! It’s exhilarating!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should government provide financial support to promote traditional performance?<br>
I have mixed feelings about this. Traditional performances are so important to our culture, but I think private organisations should donate to encourage the study of traditional arts, as well as support the performances. I think people in society would respect these organisations more. However, if this isn’t happening, I don’t think the government has any choice but to provide financial support, because this part of our culture is too important to lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is learning drama or dancing helpful for children?<br>
Learning drama and dancing is very helpful for children! Drama promotes reading and memorisation skills. Dancing promotes coordination and is a healthy activity builds strength and stamina. Both drama and dancing promote discipline and hard work when learning these arts. Performing in front of an audience also helps children overcome fear of being in front of large group of people. These are also activities that children can continue to participate in as adults if they still enjoy it.</p>

<li>
<p>How do people usually go travelling?<br>
Most people use public transportation if their destination is within the city. If people are travelling to another city or a different part of the country, they will generally go by train because it is less expensive than travelling by air. Many people prefer trains because they are much more comfortable because passengers have more room and can walk around. Of course, if people are limited on time or need to go overseas, the best option is air travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what ways can traffic conditions in a city be improved?<br>
The best way traffic conditions can be improved is by not having as many vehicles on the streets. People need to be encouraged to take public transportation whenever possible. Additionally, maybe companies and schools could adjust their start times so that people who take their cars will not all be on the streets at the exact same time. In this way, maybe the traffic flow will be better. Finally, timing traffic lights to accommodate the busiest streets in the busiest times of day can also help improve traffic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people still drive a car if public transportation is free of charge?<br>
Unfortunately, many people will continue to drive their own car regardless of the cost. I think people are always in a hurry and do not want to wait for public transportation. Public transportation is very crowded during busy times and there can be delays. However, there is traffic congestion on the streets and that causes delays too, but some people prefer to wait in the comfort of their own vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can transportation in rural areas be developed?<br>
This is a difficult question, but having transportation options available for people in rural areas is very important. Perhaps the best way to start is slowly with one bus route daily from the rural area to the outskirts of the city where it can connect with the main public transportation system. As people realise this bus is available to them, more people will be likely to use it because it gives them more access to employment opportunities and other important services.</p>

<p>Which do you prefer, family firms or non-family ones?<br>
I prefer firms that are owned and run by families. They tend to be smaller than non-family firms and are more focused on products and services that the local community wants. Also, I think the customer service is more personal and reasonable in a family owned firm. Since their customers are all local, they want to make sure they have a good reputation and customers will go back!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are important factors in making a company successful?<br>
Price and quality of the product or service is very important. No one ever wants to overspend. But sometimes, I will spend a little more to buy from a company that is local or if I know it has a good reputation for customer 33<br>
service. The location of the company can be important for some goods and services. For instance, I always buy pastries from a bakery down the street because every time I walk by, I can’t resist stopping in!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of qualities should a successful businessman have?<br>
The most important quality for any person in business is good ethics. You have to be able to trust a businessman’s word and that he will do what he says he will do. Of course, a businessman needs to be knowledgeable and experienced in his field and to be a good communicator. A person can be very intelligent, but if they cannot communicate their ideas with others, it can be detrimental to their career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What emerging industries do you know?<br>
Most of the emerging industries that I know about are science based. Robotics is emerging and growing because it will be used more and more in the business world. Other industries include aerospace and satellite communications, as well as new energy vehicles and battery development for cleaner transportation . Finally, with the increase in internet communications, there is more focus in developing cybersecurity so we can work securely on our computers. There are so many new advances that will make everyone’s lives more efficient and productive!</p>

<h1 id="no-45-拥挤的地方">No. 45 拥挤的地方</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do people like to go to crowded places? Why?<br>
I don’t think people like to go to crowded places because often that means they have to wait for whatever they need. That’s why people try to plan to go when places aren’t as crowded. Fortunately, people become accustomed to crowds and plan for the additional wait time. An example of this is using public transportation during busy times. I know it will be crowded, so I plan a little extra time and then I don’t mind being in a crowded place. Everyone there is feeling the same way I am!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the problems of traffic congestion be solved?<br>
This is a complex issue, but I think the best way to relieve traffic congestion is to clear the roads of some of the vehicles. Improving public transportation is one way of encouraging people to leave their cars at home and use public transportation. Perhaps making costs around using cars more expensive would help. If gasoline was very expensive, the fees to own a car were high, and parking fees were very high perhaps less people would want to own one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people still like to live in big cities even though there are severe traffic jams?<br>
People like to live in cities primarily because that is where they work. Even with severe traffic jams, commuting time is still less than if they lived in the suburbs and needed to commute to work into the city. Plus, there are many other advantages to living in the city. There are more things to do during your free time. There are fine restaurants and more places to find entertainment. There are plenty of beautiful parks to enjoy open space. Living in the city definitely has its advantages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What public facilities does your city have?<br>
My city has more public facilities than I can mention, but my favourite is the park. There is something for everyone there. At the entrance, there is a large open space where people gather to dance and there are walking trails that go around the back of the park where you can feel quite alone. There is also a library right around the corner from me that has recently been renovated. It has a modern multi-media centre and several quiet areas with comfortable chairs to study in. We also have a community centre with meeting rooms and a gymnasium to play sports with friends.</p>

<p>What are the benefits of younger and older generations living together? How about the drawbacks?<br>
One of the best things about younger and older generations living together is that it is easy for them to take care of each other. My grandmother moved in with us when I was young and took care of me after school when my Mom was at work. As I grew older, her eyesight started to fail and I would read her favourite books to her. It gave us a chance to know each other well. Our house seemed smaller because we didn’t have a free bedroom anymore, but we respected each other and were able to live together without disagreements that some families have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you prefer, support from family members or friends? Why?<br>
While I like support from everyone, I know the people I can depend on the most are my family members. They always have my best interest in mind and have the experience to help me when I need it. They have generously financially supported me as I have gone to school. When I need advice or help making decisions, they are the first ones I speak with. I can always depend on my family having my back!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many generations does each family have?<br>
My family has three living generations: my grandparents, my parents, and me. Some families are lucky enough to still great grandparents who are still alive so they have four generations! I suppose it is possible to have five generations in a family, but I don’t personally know anyone who is that fortunate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it important to visit family members? Why?<br>
It is vital to visit family members. Grandparents love talking about their past and it gives young people a chance to know them and know the family traditions. My grandfather enjoys teaching me his favourite hobby, calligraphy. He keeps encouraging me even though we both know I am not very good at it. But it gives us a chance to be together and enjoy each other’s company. These visits also help prevent loneliness and keeps families close, especially if everyone doesn’t live locally.</p>

<p>Do you think it is necessary to have laws on the use of mobile phones?<br>
Yes, because people can easily abuse them and, knowingly or unknowingly, harm other people. There need to be laws about talking and texting on the phone when driving, which endangers everyone around that driver because he or she is distracted from looking at the road. Also, some young people will use their cell phone inappropriately on social media and there has to be laws about cyberbullying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you like children having mobile phones?<br>
It really depends on how young they are. I feel sad when I see a group of preteens standing in a group and all of them are staring at their phones instead of talking with each other. I understand that mobile phones are very common, but I think children should know that while mobile phones will have apps and tools for better communication, they don’t replace talking to the people around you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At what age should children have mobile phones?<br>
I think children are responsible enough for a mobile phone by the age of 13. Mobile phones are expensive and they need to be able to take care of it and not be careless or forgetful. Also, by that age, they begin to need it more for school. There are several apps that would be helpful for them in school and while doing homework. Further, children are more independent by 13 and need a way to remain in contact with parents and friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are people politer now than in the past?<br>
No, I don’t think so. While most parents are very good about teaching good manners, I think many people are distracted by technology and do not follow the same polite behaviours that were considered normal in the past. How many people have you seen walking down the street intently looking at their phone and not looking up? Even perhaps bumping into others? Or people who have been listening to music with their ear buds in and are not looking up? In the past, these same people walking down the street would be smiling, nodding, and saying, “Hello” as they walk by others, but not in today’s society.</p>

<p>Do you think traditional letters are a good way to send messages?<br>
Traditional letters are a good way to send messages to my grandparents, but no one else! Email, texting, and even faxes are quicker and more direct way of communication. Most messages have some urgency and a purpose to them, so getting the message to the right person in a timely manner is important. Messages can get to the recipient through electronic means in a few seconds, rather than several days. My grandparents consider the letters I send them “keepsakes” because they enjoy seeing the development of my penmanship!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people make phone calls instead of sending messages when there is something important?<br>
Phone calls are more personal than sending a message and you know the person has received the information you wanted them to have. People can respond to each other instantly and clear up any confusion that can sometimes happen with electronic messages. Also, if the message is urgent, you know that message isn’t waiting in their email unopened. When the call is about something very important, personal interaction is a much better way to communicate so you can make sure that the person you called heard and understood the message in its entirety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it more polite to make phone calls than send text messages?<br>
I don’t think that is true in today’s society, but it may be true in some cases. Businesses will text me when my order is ready. My airline will text me if my flight is delayed. And I am not offended at all! I would rather read a quick text than be called or listen to a voice message. My friends all prefer texting to phone calls. However, the only exception I can think of is my grandparents might be upset if I texted them rather than called them. They have trouble reading the texts on their phone and will often just ignore them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does technological development have a negative impact on communication among people?<br>
I think it creates a different type of communication, some of it is positive, but some of it is negative. Technological developments have allowed people to keep contact with people who have moved. This is a good thing because these are people who may have been forgotten. The negative impact is that communication with current acquaintances can become superficial. Instead of taking the time to personally interact, which allows people to truly get to know each other better and become friends, people will briefly interact electronically. Also, people can be so focused on their phones, they do not even notice the people physically around them!</p>

<p>In what ways can we fix traffic problems?<br>
I think we can fix traffic problems by encouraging others to use public transportation. I think public transportation keeps private vehicles off the road and obviously less vehicles on the road means less traffic. I also think that we can help the traffic problem by scheduling our errands appropriately. If we're able to do several errands at one time, I think that's less trips out of the house and less trips on the road and that also will help with the traffic congestion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it fair to limit the use of private cars?<br>
I think it's fair to limit the use of private cars. I think it's good to encourage the use of public transportation and if you have private cars, you're going to use them to be driving and that's going to contribute to the traffic problem. I think people can use private cars if they're going places where public transportation doesn't go, but that's not usually the case. Our public transportation system is very adequate, and it generally takes us wherever we need to go. Private cars are a luxury and they should be used as luxuries, not as a means of daily use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should governments encourage people to use public transportation?<br>
I think government should encourage people to use public transportation. I think that's the only way around the traffic problem. How they do that is a different story. Do they encourage them to use it by limiting private cars or do they have a public relations campaign to encourage the use of it? I think it's important that the government supports those people who use public transportation and in doing so hopefully this traffic problem will be lightened somewhat, if not resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the most popular means of transportation in your country?<br>
Public transportation is very popular here. We have a bus system, as well as a train system. Both are very adequate. They take us wherever we need to go the only thing is we have to somehow change our schedule to meet what times the buses or trains are running. It's not always exactly when we want to go, but very quickly you learn how to adjust your schedule so that it's easier to get from here to there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer public or private transportation? Why?<br>
Private transportation really is a luxury and it's nice when you indulge in that luxury, but I know that public transportation is much better for everybody. I think it's excessive if everybody uses private transportation because I see the environment as a very important issue and I don't like to see air quality go down. I do like to use public transportation at every opportunity that I can and it would be really nice if everyone else did as well.</p>

<li>
<p>On what occasion do people usually apologise to others?<br>
People will apologise to others when they have done something to hurt or inconvenience others. For instance, if someone said something that unintentionally hurt someone else, apologising is the best thing to do. If a person is late when meeting someone, it is appropriate to apologise for not being punctual. Apologising helps people to begin talking again so they can repair their relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people in your country like to say “sorry”?<br>
Yes, they do. If someone accidentally bumps into you, they will say, “sorry” or “excuse me” and that’s fine. But people who have a hard time apologising will give this shortened version of an apology which I don’t think is good manners. If someone is late, I think they should say, “I am sorry I am late” rather than a brief “sorry”. To me, an apology sounds more sincere when it is used in a complete sentence!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people should apologise for anything wrong they do?<br>
I think if people feel sorry for something they have done that is wrong, they should apologise. Otherwise, their relationship with the other person could remain damaged. If someone said they were going to meet me at a movie theatre and didn’t come, then she never mentioned it to me, I would be hurt. The only way to start to repair that is with an apology. On the other hand, if people do not feel sorry for what they have done, they should not apologise because that is a lie and people shouldn’t lie to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people refuse to say “sorry” to others?<br>
Some people have a hard time accepting responsibility for things they have done wrong. It is easier for them to blame other people than admit they are the ones who are wrong. They might say, “I wouldn’t said that if she didn’t say something first.” Others feel that sometimes things aren’t important enough to apologise for and only feel they need to apologise for what they consider to be important things. They think that the other person is over-reacting. I don’t really understand why saying these two words, “I’m sorry” can be so difficult for some people, but I don’t think it is healthy for them.</p>

<p>Do people in your country set goals?<br>
Some people in my country set goals, but some don’t. People who are successful always set goals because it gives them something to work towards. It gives them direction in their lives for things they want to achieve and things they feel will make them proud and happy to have accomplished. Their goals are well defined and include specific, measurable results achieved within a specific timeframe. I think people who do not set goals tend to live life day by day and may not feel the same purpose in their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people usually set long-term goals or short-term ones?<br>
People usually set one or two long-term goals and then set several short-term goals to help them reach these long-term goals. It’s easier to achieve the big goal by breaking it into smaller, more achievable goals. Each time a short-term goal is met, a person stays motivated by knowing that they are closer to achieving their long-term goal. Another reason there are more short-term goals is because many are unrelated to the long-term goal, e.g. finishing my studying early on Saturday so I can go out with my friends on Saturday evening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is setting goals important in the workplace?<br>
Setting goals are vital in the workplace. Goals provide a direction for the company for how they intend to be more successful. These goals can be short term, like monthly sales and production goals and long-term goals like growing their market share to 25% in ten years or build a second manufacturing facility. Not only are goals good for the business, they are important for employees too. They let the employees know what they need to focus on in the upcoming year. They keep employees motivated and provide a basis for pride when goals are achieved!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between goals set by old people and young people?<br>
Young people are at the beginning of their lives and, because of that, they will set more long-term goals than old people. These goals will be about their education, careers, and what they want to do with their lives. The older people get, the more they have already accomplished in their lives. Their formal education and career goals are now in their past. They will generally set short term goals with flexible completion dates, for example, learning a new hobby that they have more time for now that they are retired, or personal weekly goals like swimming three times per week or volunteering weekly at the local schools.</p>

<p><strong>What are the benefits of younger and older generations living together? How about the drawbacks?</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons to live with people from a different generation. They can teach us many things and we can learn about our culture and traditions. However, some drawbacks would be that they are <strong><tagname style="color:red">they are stuck in their ways</tagname></strong> and find it difficult to understand the younger generation.</p>
<p><strong>Which do you prefer, support from family members or friends? Why?</strong></p>
<p>I think that support from family members is <strong><tagname style="color:red">better than</tagname></strong> support from friends. Your family will love you <strong><tagname style="color:red">without any judgement</tagname></strong> and they will always be there when you need them. They also don’t expect anything in return, and they <strong><tagname style="color:red">support you unconditionally</tagname></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How many generations do each family have?</strong></p>
<p>Families can have <strong><tagname style="color:red">up to four generations</tagname></strong>. There can be great grandparents, grandparents, parents and children. Families that have this many generations are lucky, and they can learn a lot from each other. They should spend quality time with their elders and <strong><tagname style="color:red">savour the moments they share together</tagname></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Is it important to visit family members? Why?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to <tagname style="color:red">keep in touch with</tagname>our family members and visit them <strong><tagname style="color:red">as often as we can</tagname></strong>. Our family loves us unconditionally and is always be there for us. We can also learn a lot from older generations and life is too short not to make time for them.</p>
<h2 id="教导你的人">教导你的人</h2>
<p><strong>What qualities do you think a good teacher should have?</strong><br>
Being a teacher is not everyone’s cup of tea and there are some special qualities that you should have in order to be a great teacher. Patience and kindness are the top qualities of any good teacher I have met, and every teacher should <strong><tagname style="color:red">possess</tagname></strong> them.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you think can learn better? Old people or youngsters?</strong><br>
I think that youngsters can learn new skills better than older people. They are <strong><tagname style="color:red">more open to</tagname></strong> new ideas and they are willing to try new things. Older people however are <strong><tagname style="color:red">set in their ways</tagname></strong>  and it can be difficult for them to learn.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the best age for children to go to school?</strong><br>
In my opinion, children should <strong><tagname style="color:red">attend school</tagname></strong>  after seven years old. The first years of their lives are important, and they should be <strong><tagname style="color:red">filled with play and imagination</tagname></strong>. School can be very rigid, and it can be difficult for young children to pay attention for long periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Do you prefer to study by yourself or with your friends?</strong><br>
My ideal study environment is to study by myself <strong><tagname style="color:red">away from others and distractions</tagname></strong>. I think that it is easy to <strong><tagname style="color:red">get off track</tagname></strong> when you study with friends. However, when you are studying alone, you are able to concentrate better and <strong><tagname style="color:red">stay on top of things</tagname></strong>.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of traveling by plane?<br>
There are several advantages of traveling by plane. The most obvious advantages are the ability to travel great distances in a shorter period of time, the convenience, and that traveling by plane is the safest way to travel! Plane travel allows people to maximize their time at their destination because they are spending less time in transit. A flight between Beijing and Guangzhou is only about three and half hours compared to over 20 hours when driving by car. Also, air travel is considerably safer than driving and is considered the safest means of transportation. Traveling by plane is fast, convenient and safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people prefer to travel by train?<br>
Many people prefer to travel by train. To begin with, it is much less expensive to travel by train than other modes of transportation and it is more comfortable. This is important when traveling with a family. If the destination is not a great distance away, it may actually be faster and more convenient to go by train! Also, passengers can see the beautiful countryside and, for longer trips, buy sleeping accommodations so they can arrive refreshed. Finally, compared to travel by air, people have much more freedom to move around. For instance, they can get up to walk to the dining car for something to eat. There are many reasons to prefer travel by train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the disadvantages of living near an airport?<br>
I think the main disadvantages of living near an airport are the noise and air pollution. Airplanes are noisy and this noise is very disruptive. If people live near a large airport, they can expect to hear noise 24 hours a day. Not only can this noise be disruptive during the day, but it can interfere with sleep. Of course, the sound of airplanes is louder outside and that may limit people’s desire to enjoy outdoor recreation. In addition to the noise pollution outdoors, the air quality may be negatively affected and that can be unhealthy. When considering the noise and poorer air quality, I would definitely prefer not to live near an airport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is working at the airport different from working at other places?<br>
Airports are unique because of their strict schedules. Employees need to place a high emphasis on customer satisfaction even though they are working under the pressure of constant deadlines. Every step of the flight process must be strictly, and politely, monitored so that these schedules are met. This includes everything from check in, checking luggage, gate operations, boarding, and deplaning. And all of this must be done while ensuring customers are happy with their experience. This becomes complicated when things happen outside of an employee’s control, like severe weather that causes flight delays. Then employees are dealing with large numbers of upset customers. This is very stressful and exhausting. Very few industries have the pressure to maintain schedules as closely as airports and employees have to do it with a smile no matter how tired they are!</p>

<p>Do you think it is strange to make friends online?<br>
I don’t think it is strange at all to make friends online! I can meet people with common interests and communicate conveniently through social media. While it is important to be careful sharing information when developing friendships online, I have met many people who have similar interests by participating in forums dedicated to my interests. For instance, I enjoy photography and have received excellent advice on where to buy quality equipment inexpensively from an online friend. Another thing I especially like about meeting people online is that we can communicate through social media. It makes communication more relaxed because we can “talk” on our own schedule without lengthy time obligations. I definitely count my online friends as my friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people have few friends?<br>
Some people have only a few friends because they feel true friendships take time to nurture and develop. For instance, I have many acquaintances, but only a few close friends. I consider a friend to be someone I have known for a while and can confide in. In my mind, it takes time and many interactions to grow from being an acquaintance into a trusted friend. That is why some of my friends are people I have known since elementary school, while other friendships I have developed more recently are with people who I have spent more time with. When I go out with a group of people, I am friendly with everyone, but only a few are truly my friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is more important, new friendships or old ones?<br>
Although I think both old and new friendships are special, I think new ones may be more important. People’s interests, stage of life, and even where they live can change. I have great memories of my childhood friend, Laura, and we remain in touch through social media. When I go home, I will be sure to visit with her. However, now that I have graduated and started my new job in a new city, I am meeting friends through work and am spending time with them. I have also met people in my building. I think it is only natural to develop new friendships as our life circumstances change. While I can maintain contact with old friends, sometimes it makes more sense to put time and energy into new friendships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do companies welcome their new employees?<br>
To begin with, usually on the first day, new employees will be given a tour of the department and building by a supervisor and will be introduced to their colleagues. Companies want to welcome their new employees because they hope they will have a long and successful business association together. Secondly, when companies hire new employees, there often is an orientation meeting which allows the company to give new employees important information about policies and procedures. This orientation also allows the new employees to meet each other if they work in different departments. Lastly, frequently supervisors will invite the new employees to dinner so they can get to know each other better. These are all ways to make new employees feel welcome.</p>

<p>Is colour important for clothing?<br>
Colour is very important for clothing and is vital to learn about. It is especially important to dress in appropriate colours for specific occasions. Also, colours mean different things in different cultures. For instance, if you are invited to a wedding in the United States, the bride wears white as it is the colour of purity. If a guest wears all white, it is considered rude. While in China, black is associated with mourning and would never be appropriate to wear for anyone to wear at a wedding. Moreover, appropriate colours are also important in business. You have to dress appropriately for interviews and meeting clients because you will be judged on this first impression. Generally, muted colours are best as those are more accepted in the workplace. Colour choice in clothing says a lot about an individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should course-books be colourful?<br>
Absolutely. Colourful course-books create interest compared to a text book that is printed only in black and white. While this would make the cost to produce the course-book more expensive, not to mention the price to purchase it, it would make the book so much more readable. Firstly, charts and illustrations can be highlighted with colour to point out the significant points more clearly. Colour contrast can also be used to show comparative information and exceptions more clearly. Secondly, photographs stand out and look so much more real in colour than if they are printed in grey-scale. These are the differences that can make a course-book more interesting to read and easier to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What colour do you think people would choose when decorating their houses?<br>
Colour selections for someone’s home is a very individual choice because it sets the mood they want for each room. Personally, I tend to like neutral colours that represent wood, earth, and water tones for wall colours. Also, these wall tones don’t clash with each other as you walk from room to room. I feel these neutral colours can easily be accented with brighter colours to make a room look more complete. Colour can be added through curtains, pillows, and wall hangings to create the desired mood. Also, these items can also be easily changed to create a different look without having to change the wall colour. However, like I said at the beginning, colour is a very individual choice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think the colour of a company’s dress code represents the image of the corporation?<br>
The management of a company puts time and money into developing the company dress code in order to express their desired image. The company is trying to project the principles and standards of their company through colour. They want their customers and vendors to have trust and confidence in their business product and the company as a whole. Also, when everyone follows the dress code, it shows people outside of the company that the employees feel united and loyal. Besides, the colour of a company’s dress code may be different depending on the type of corporation. A conservative accounting business would most probably have a conservative grey colour to display confidence whereas a food corporation might have green to represent freshness. Colour definitely represents the image of the company!</p>

<p>What is the difference between current teachers and those in the past?<br>
While both current and past teachers have always wanted what is best for their students, I think today’s teachers pay more attention to the comprehensive development of students. Current teachers definitely focus on academics, but they also try to help students cultivate a variety of interests and hobbies to make the student more well-rounded, and hopefully a happier and healthier person. The emphasis in the past was solely on a student’s academic performance. Teachers in the past were more concerned with forcing students to complete their assignments and even punishing those who did not by corporal punishment. Today’s teachers have a more holistic view of each student than teachers in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between being taught by teachers and by AI<br>
I think the main difference is that teachers can provide human interaction to students. A good teacher is able to recognize when a student is struggling when learning before the student becomes frustrated. Students know that a person is there to help them with the learning process and acknowledge them when they succeed! However, if students are being taught by AI, they may not have the opportunity to tell the AI what they really need or get answers to their questions. What’s more, another difference between them may be the quality of the teacher vs. the AI. Although there are many teachers in our country, there are not always enough good teachers. An AI may also be a good option if there is a shortage of teachers in a specific subject area. Moreover, AI may be a way for motivated students with aptitude in the subject area to learn at his or her own pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between private schools and public schools?<br>
There are many differences between private and public schools. First, private schools generally have smaller class sizes and a more rigorous curriculum than public schools. Sometimes this curriculum is focused on a specific subject area, like languages, mathematics, or the arts. Secondly, private schools are very expensive with high tuition rates; not all of the families in China can afford them. So, the private school is also called the ‘exclusive school’ in China. Last, since public schools are generally larger than private schools, there is often a larger variety of activities that students can be involved in after school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between international schools and other schools?<br>
There are many differences between international schools and other schools in China. To begin with, International schools are mainly attended by foreign students and have more emphasis on the study of English. Also, they usually follow the same curriculum as schools in the United States or Great Britain. Subjects like social studies are presented from a global perspective and are often integrated with other subjects like science, etc. On the other hand, regular schools generally teach Chinese students in Mandarin. They have a specific educational goal for each student. Their emphasis is on educating each student to be able to pass and get good marks for the university entrance examination.</p>

<h1 id="no-5-很累却要保持清醒">No. 5 很累却要保持清醒</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What kind of people lack sleep?<br>
I think most people suffer from lack of sleep, at least most people between the ages of 12 and 60! People are putting in long hours to get their work done, dealing with stress, and trying to balance work and home. When time is short, sleep is often cut short too. Additionally, the worry associated with this stress often disrupts a person’s sleep and make it not as refreshing as it should be. Students put a great deal of time into their studies for exams and are worrying about their future choices. Adults also deal with deadlines and usually work long hours. The stress of balancing work and family life also interferes with both the amount of time set aside for sleep and quality of sleep. It is a difficult cycle for people to deal with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people feel tired a lot nowadays?<br>
I think people feel tired because sleep is the first thing people sacrifice when they “run out of time”. As I said in the last question, people have a lot of responsibilities by studying and working a lot of hours, along with the stress of trying to balance life and work. Everything seems to be a priority except sleep. While learning and using time management skills won’t cure the problem all of the time for everyone, I think using good time management skills will help people focus to be able to get more done and allow them to prioritise sleep as part a healthy routine!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do people keep awake when they are tired?<br>
I think I know all the tricks to stay awake when I am tired. Drinking caffeinated drinks is usually the first thing I try. Turning lights on brighter around me helps trick my mind into thinking it is really isn’t as late as it is. Sometimes a few minutes of activity will clear my head like a brisk walk. Splashing cold water on my face and wrists can help me be more alert. My last trick is to take several deep breaths to get oxygen flowing and this is more effective if I stretch with the breathing. There are lots of ways to try to stay awake when you are tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What occasions do people need to keep awake even though they feel tired?<br>
There are many occasions that people need to keep awake no matter how tired they are. I divide them into ‘urgent’, ‘important’, and ‘should’ occasions. Staying awake while driving is an urgent situation and if you can’t stay awake, it is important to stop until you can. There are many important occasions that it is better to be awake, but isn’t a “life or death” situation like driving. For example, staying awake in class is important for obvious reasons. A “should’ occasion example is when my family went to a play last month. My father fell asleep and my mother was so angry. It definitely would have been better for him if stayed awake! I think we can all think of many occasions where we struggled to stay alert!</p>

<p>How do people usually choose gifts?<br>
Gifts are meant to make other people happy. So, people usually give a great deal of thought about the type of occasion, what others want, and about what they can afford to spend before choosing a gift! These things don’t always align, so often there is a lot to think about. For occasions like a for young child’s birthday party, a small, fun gift like an inexpensive toy is very appropriate and delights the child receiving it. Other times, giving money is the best option. This way the people receiving the gift can decide what they want for themselves, for instance for a wedding or house warming gift. If a person is financially well-off and does not want or need anything, often the best idea is to give a hand-made gift. These will provide the sentimental value that will make the recipient happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people find it hard to choose gifts?<br>
Some people really struggle choosing a gift because they want to give the perfect gift that will make the recipient happy and feel special. A gift doesn’t have to be expensive to be appreciated and well-received, however the choice of a gift is also a reflection on the giver. If someone chooses a gift without putting any thought into it, the recipient will know that and will be disappointed. Also, there are so many choices when buying a gift and being able to buy things on-line offers even more options to choose from. Sometimes it’s just hard to make a decision and settle on that perfect gift!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think useful gifts are always more suitable than those useless ones?<br>
Sometimes I think getting a frivolous gift is fun, but in general, I think useful gifts are much better to give and receive. For example, suppose a teenage girl gets an oversized stuffed animal and a bag for her 16th birthday. It lightens everyone’s mood when she unwraps the stuffed animal and everyone says it is “cute”. However, it isn’t a very practical gift and will probably be thrown out and forgotten very soon. On the other hand, the bag is something she will use and enjoy repeatedly. A practical and useful gift will be a longer lasting memento of the occasion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people give the same gifts as they did in the past?<br>
I don't think so. There are a variety of new choices of gifts to give because of advances in electronics and the ability to buy things from the internet. Nowadays, everyone wants the latest models of electronics, like cell phones, tablets, or wireless accessories. It makes for many new choices! My mother just purchased a tablet for my grandmother. It has the same functionality as a cell phone, but she is able to see screen better. This would never have been a possibility a generation ago! However, gifts in the past were limited to what could be made or purchased locally. I think that is the difference. Besides, giving money for certain occasions has been customary for a long time and continues to be appropriate.</p>

<h1 id="no-7-借过的好用东西">No. 7 借过的好用东西</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What kind of things do people borrow from each other?<br>
I think of small things that people borrow because they need or want them for a short period of time. I have some books that I am happy to let friends borrow. My friend and I are the same size and we will sometimes share clothes. My father needed a tool to change a light fixture and borrowed it from a neighbour. Last month, I forgot money for lunch as school and my teacher saw that I wasn’t eating and loaned me money for food. I was sure to pay her back the next day. I am uncomfortable borrowing money, even in small amounts! People usually avoid borrowing expensive things, like computers, because you are responsible for it and would feel terrible if it broke while you had it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the things that people do not choose to lend to others?<br>
Like I said in my last answer, people don’t really like to loan money or expensive items. If you loan someone money and they can not pay you back like you had agreed, the relationship will become strained and even ruined. Other things that people don’t like to lend are expensive things like electronics or sentimental items like family heirlooms. If something happened to them while they were in the possession of someone else, they could be expensive or even impossible to repair. Not that anyone would be purposely careless, but things happen in life. If I loaned my laptop to my best friend, I know she would do her best to take care of it, but she accidentally dropped it, I know I would feel resentful because of the inconvenience it would cause me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we always need to get permissions from others before using something they have?<br>
Yes, we should always get permission from others before using their possessions. If you don’t, that is stealing! That is a point I keep trying to tell my younger brother who thinks nothing of coming into my room and “borrowing” my things. He has borrowed my tennis racket, my electronics, and even music from my music collection without asking. It would not be so bad if I didn’t have to go into his room to get them back! Of course, I would lend these items to him, but if he would ask first, I would know where these items were so I wouldn’t be looking for them thinking that I misplaced them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think of copying ideas from others?<br>
This is a difficult question because I think that someone can take a good idea and make it even better. However, I think credit has to be given to the person who thought of the idea to begin with. Then the question comes up, what if this person doesn’t want you to use their idea. If you can’t convince him or her to work with you on it, then I think it is better to try to find your own creative thoughts around the that idea to come up with your own work. Ideas can always be improved on and that’s what helps science growing and expanding. It is important to share ideas, but I don’t think copying them is fair.</p>

<p>Should kids know more about stars and planets?<br>
Kids should learn about the stars and planets. This is a science that has been studied since ancient times. So much is known about space and there is so much more to learn. While most kids no longer need to know how to navigate the ocean by the stars, it is fascinating to notice how the stars “change” in the sky depending on the time and season. This allow students to know more about the Earth’s rotation and our position in the universe. The advances used in the study of space have helped many other areas of science and is beneficial for everyone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is high technology helpful for star watching?<br>
Star watching can be done with everything from the naked eye on a particularly dark night to a very expensive telescope. A lot can be learned by looking at the night skies with only your eyes and matching them with images of the constellations. It is easy and inexpensive to learn the location and names of prominent stars this way. However, there is inexpensive technology that can be very helpful too. There are apps that you can download on your phone and as you position your phone in a certain direction, it will identify what you are looking at for you. Nowadays, technology makes stars and planets accessible to everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of people are interested in stars?<br>
I think people who are interested in the stars are filled with curiosity about things they can’t touch and feel. There is so little known about the stars, people use their curiosity and imagination to fuel their interest in learning more. Most of these people are just so impressed with the immense majesty of the stars and planets that they enjoy sky watching! Some people make star watching more of a hobby. They may buy an inexpensive telescope and go to remote areas on weekends and look for specific astronomical events. Still others want to know the answers to questions about space and everything in it and study stars in earnest!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people like to watch movies about stars or planets?<br>
Many people enjoy movies about stars or planets because they can spark your imagination. There is a genre called “science fiction” and many of these movies are about people going to other planets and exploring. Often, they are learning about how to live in that planet’s atmosphere and sometimes they interact with alien life who look very different from us. The more modern movies about stars or planets have brilliant video effects about space travel that capture your interest. These are things no one would ever see on earth, and even though it is just fiction, it can be fun to imagine going to other planets!</p>

<p>What do you think is more important? Reading or writing?<br>
This is not an easy question at all because both are important, but I think the ability to read is more important than writing because it needs to be learned first. If a person reads enough different material, they will naturally develop into a good writer. They will become familiar with vocabulary and different sentence structures through their reading and will use these in their writing. Reading allows people to understand what ideas other people are trying communicate. This allow people to learn through their reading. However, people who do not write well can try to get their thoughts and ideas across to others through speech and, perhaps, even art!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who needs to have good writing skills?<br>
It is so important for everyone to be able to write; it will be hard to narrow down to specific groups of people! News and magazine writers need to be able to write concisely, without personal bias, so people will know and understand the events happening in the world. It may be especially important for people who work in scientific fields like medicine, so there is clarity when it comes to medical advances and patient care. The ability to write is important for people in the legal profession so that laws are written without ambiguity and are easy to interpret. I think anyone in authority should have good writing skills so that their thoughts are expressed clearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At what age should children start to read?<br>
I think children should not be forced to read too young because then they may get frustrated and not want to learn. Some children who are read to frequently in the home develop an interest in reading early, but most children are ready to start when they are in kindergarten usually by age 5. Children can learn simple characters and will soon be able to expand on that. While young children may not have the manual coordination to write characters yet, they usually take pride in identifying them. So, I think child should start to read at the age of around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where can people get more information from, words or pictures?<br>
There is a saying that “a picture can say a thousand words”. Well, I don’t believe that! While an illustration or picture can help place emphasis on what an idea is, words are much more specific and explicit in getting the information across to people. Sometimes words don’t keep the reader’s interest, so they do not grasp the main idea. But I think that if something is well written, there is less room for interpretation of what the author is trying to communicate.</p>

<li>
<p>Why do people get bored?<br>
People get bored for different reasons, some are physical and some are mental. Some people who get bored easily are people who are lacking healthy nutrition or rest. The physical part of a person certainly affects the mental and emotional parts! Other people get bored because they have been in the same daily routine for a long time, lack choices in their recreational activities, and perhaps even have a low level of mental stimulation. Many people find it hard to break out of a boring routine and try a new hobby or meet new people, even though this would provide the type of mental stimulation that would be helpful for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are people less interested in reading books nowadays?<br>
Books take a long time to read and people don’t have the time to dedicate to reading for enjoyment like they did before. Students and working adults have a lot of time commitments and less free time. Printed books seem to be replaced by ebooks because they are more convenient to have with you. If people do have an interest in books, sometimes they will listen to an audio book or ebook while they are doing something else, like working out at the gym or while they are on public transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are all the boring jobs going to be done by robots in the future?<br>
Most industries are going to become more automated in the future. People have already found robots are taking over more and more of the routine tasks that are part of a job. But it is important to realise that while many of the routine tasks are going to be done by robots, AI cannot provide the type of individual critical thinking skills required for many jobs. The question is: what is a boring job? Some people think that child care can be boring. Would a robot ever replace a human being in a nursery? I hope not! Many people in the sales field have repetitive jobs. It also can very repetitive, but they could never be replaced by a robot because of the required critical thinking skills. I think there will be jobs that will not be done by robots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people choose boring jobs?<br>
There are times when choosing a boring job is not necessarily a poor choice. Not all boring jobs are low-paying. Some people choose to do jobs they find boring because they are making enough money to make a good living and support their families. My college-aged cousin works as a landscaper during summer vacation. He doesn’t particularly like the work, but it pays well and it helps him pay for his college expenses. Others choose boring jobs because they save their energy for activities outside of their work day. My neighbour has two school aged children and she works in a retail job so she can earn a some money, but still get her kids ready for school in the morning and be home for them when they get home. It is a personal choice.</p>

<p>How should young people perform on their first jobs?<br>
It is extremely important for young people to perform well on their first jobs. It is vital to carry out all of the responsibilities of their job to the very best of their abilities! This will show they are hard-working, dedicated to the company, and eager to take on new responsibilities. They will probably need to put extra time into their jobs to learn as much as they can about the job and company. This knowledge and increased skill set will help them as they advance in their career. Doing these things will help young people perform well on their first job and will be the foundation for a good career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can people improve their job performance?<br>
As I mentioned before, it is important for people to learn all of the responsibilities of their job and to do them competently and with enthusiasm! It is important to be organised so that none of their responsibilities are overlooked which would reflect very badly on them! Putting in extra hours at the workplace will help employees develop this organisation, especially when people are just starting their job. Something else that is sometimes overlooked is the ability to get along with others. It is important to develop good relationships with supervisors and co-workers because they are excellent sources of information and help if you need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What skill set should a manager have?<br>
Managers should have a variety of skills to be successful because they need to be able to lead people to successfully complete their responsibilities in a fair and timely manner. It is a big job and in order to do this, a manager must be very observant, organised, and detailed oriented in order to meet deadlines. Managers also need to understand the job functions within the department so they can recognise if there is a problem and respond to it proactively. A manager can also look at the work flow and make suggestions to improve productivity or cost savings for the company. This is where the ability to problem-solve is very important!</p>
</li>

<p>Do you think what you have learned in university is going to help in your future job?<br>
I definitely feel what I learned in university will help me be successful in my future job. I feel fortunate that my education included many things that will help me be organised and productive. My coursework in finance and languages will certainly help me in the international business world, but the technology courses have given me a strong background to be effective in my job. This education and experience have broadened my understanding of the expectations in the workforce and I feel I am ready to be productive and successful!</p>

<p>Do people spend too much money on their birthday parties or weddings?<br>
Birthday parties and weddings are very special events and most people do spend too much money on them. On the other hand, if people want to spend an excessive amount of money on a party or wedding because it brings them joy, and they have the money to do so, they should! However, for most ordinary people, it is important not to spend more than you can afford. People should not go heavily into debt to pay for that special party because they may find they can’t do the things they want to do in the future. After all, what is more important, a wedding or a down payment on a home!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much do you think people should spend on their birthday parties or weddings?<br>
How much people should spend depends on how much money a family has saved and earns in a year. I think that people should not spend more on a birthday party than they can afford without going into any debt and with enough money left over to pay for their living expenses after! Weddings are more of an occasion than birthday parties because weddings are lifetime memories for the bride and groom and their families. However, often society puts pressure on people to have a more expensive wedding than the family can really afford.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is the better way to retain memories, by videos or photos?<br>
Both are great ways to retain memories, but I think photos are a better way to retain memories because they are more convenient to display and accessible to show others. I can frame a photo and place it on a piece of furniture. Every time I walk by it, I will remember the experience. I can make a collage of photos and place them on the wall by my front door. When people come in and see them, they will see photos of this special memory. If my friends ask about a recent event, I can show them a quick picture on my cell phone rather than expect them to politely sit through a longer video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can forgetful people remember things better?<br>
Forgetful people have to work to organise themselves to remember things. One way is to write things down on a calendar. If they use a cell phone calendar, they can set it so that it gives them audio reminders when they need to do things and for appointments! If they use a printed calendar, they have to make sure they look at it every day. Some forgetful people will use a task list where they will write down tasks that they have to do and check them off as they complete them. These can all be part of a time management system. Of course, they only work if the forgetful person remembers to do them!</p>

<p>What is the difference between face to face conversation and phone conversation?<br>
Face to face conversations are nice because you can see the person you are talking with. So much of communication is unspoken, seeing someone’s facial expressions and body language as you talk can add so much to the discussion. Phone conversations tend to be faster and are often considered more convenient for that reason. Another difference is that phone conversations seem to be getting replaced by texts. But face to face conversations seem to be getting more popular, especially with apps like WeChat where face to face conversations can occur electronically!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which one do you prefer, face to face conversation or phone conversation?<br>
I prefer face to face conversations to phone conversations. I like to see the person I am speaking with. When I ask, “How are you feeling?”, I can see with my eyes if the person is telling the truth or just being polite. It is easier to express emotions face to face. I can use facial expressions as cues whether to pursue the conversation or change the subject. By reading body language, it is easy to tell if a person is busy and only has a few minutes to talk, so there aren’t awkward delays trying to find a way to end the conversation. Also, there are far less distractions face to face, and therefore, the interaction you have is more meaningful than by phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any disadvantages of face to face conversation?<br>
There are a few disadvantages to face to face conversations. The biggest disadvantage is you must maintain your appearance for a face to face conversation! I can speak to someone on the phone while wearing my favourite fuzzy bathrobe and comfortable slippers with unbrushed hair, but that would be totally inappropriate for most, if not all, face to face conversations! Another disadvantage is if the listener is inattentive. The speaker can feel hurt that he or she is not getting the expected amount of attention. Often, then the speaker then starts into a awkward monologue until the meeting can be ended.</p>

<p>What food is popular throughout the world?<br>
I think one of the most popular foods throughout the world is eggs. Eggs are such a versatile food. They can be scrambled, fried, poached, boiled. So much can be made with them and they can be seasoned in so many ways and eaten at every meal. In France, eggs are beaten until they are very fluffy and baked to make a breakfast soufflé. In Mexico, they have a famous dessert called a flan. The eggs are lightly beaten with milk, sweetened with sugar, and baked. It tastes similar to a custard. People eat different types of eggs. While chicken eggs are the most popular, many dishes can be made out of duck eggs, quail eggs, and even ostrich eggs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people use imported products?<br>
People use imported products to supplement their own locally grown and produced products. For instance, bananas and many citrus fruits only grow in tropical climates. If you happen to live in an Arid climate, the only way to enjoy these fruits is to import them. Imported food is different from what we are used to eating and is interesting to taste. As an example, imported food products are practical if people are cooking an international cuisine when there are no substitutes locally for that ingredient, for instance, using a spice from India. Often, people will buy an imported product because it is considered “the best” from that country, for example Cuban cigars are recognised world-wide for their quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people living in different regions like different food?<br>
People grow up eating in a way similar to how their parents ate when they were growing up. Their tastes develop a liking for that kind of food from a very young age. The food most people eat is what is available locally because local food is usually fresher and less expensive. If someone is born and raised in a tropical climate, their tastes may more naturally gravitate to tropical fruits. However, if a person is born and raised in a very cold climate, the flavour of tropical fruits will seem very foreign and it will probably take some time to develop a fondness for that type of food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do different places have their own popular products?<br>
Absolutely. This is because different places have their own locally grown products that have been farmed and produced in their area for generations. The local people are very familiar with their own local products and know how to produce them in the best and most delicious ways. They just have more experience with their own local products. Once people outside of the area realise this how delicious these products are, they want these products to be available to them also!</p>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of taking photos with smartphones?<br>
It seems that everyone carries a smartphone with them all of the time, so it is very convenient to take a photo with it when a “photo opportunity” comes up! You don’t need to carry a separate camera. The photos are stored digitally on your smartphone and can easily be shared with others via social media. Most smartphones have apps which allows you to add special effects and edit right there on the phone! A disadvantage is of course, a smart phone is not as good as a camera. The photo will not look as professional as one taken with a camera. The camera has better picture quality and has manual control of features that make the photograph a better quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think photographers are artists?<br>
Some photographers are artists; others are people who like to take pictures. A true artist will take photographs that elicits an emotion from the person viewing it. Perhaps a photographer will take beautiful landscape pictures or capture feelings of the people who are subjects in the photo. Some photographers will work with special effects like filters to enhance colours which creates more interest when viewing their work. Some work with time exposures to capture the movement or growth of an object over time. These people are artists. Then there are photographers like me. I just like to take pictures for the memories and because it is fun!</p>

<p>What are the benefits of learning painting for children?<br>
Children love to paint and it can be very beneficial for them. Young children can learn their colours, basic shapes, and patterns through painting. They learn about mixing colours. It also helps them develop their fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination. As they get a bit older, they develop some decision-making skills as they decide what to paint and what colours to use for different parts of the painting. Some children are able to express their emotions through painting and use of colour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can anyone become a famous artist through hard work?<br>
No, I don’t think just anyone can become a famous artist, even with hard work. Everyone can improve on their skills through hard work to become proficient. However, a person has to be born with certain inherent abilities and then, with a lot of hard work and some luck, they might become famous. These natural abilities include an inclination to being observant, as well ability to see depth and colour nuances at a young age. Artists also have imagination and strive to have others see through their eyes. Even people who are born with these abilities still have to have the interest and determination to work to become that special artist.</p>

<p>How do advertisements influence children?<br>
Advertising has a great effect on children. On one hand, advertisements give children more opportunities to know more about the world and see many new and interesting products and innovations. These cannot be learned in schools or taught by parents. On the other hand, some advertisements may induce children, which is not conducive to children’s growth in a right way. It's terrible that a child might want to try drinking because he saw a beer advertisement. Therefore, the influence of advertising on children can be good or bad, parents should pay attention to distinguishing between the two for their children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should advertising aimed at kids be prohibited?<br>
I think that we do not need to prohibit the advertisement aimed at kids. It is too absolute, but it should be controlled and guided. From a child's point of view, children lack experience and judgment, sometimes they cannot understand the difference between TV advertisements and their favourite animated cartoons. Children's inappropriate behaviour, for example, violence, addiction to games, ignorance of teachers should not appear in advertisements. Some special advertisements, such as tobacco and alcohol, should avoid the use of children's images. As long as the guidance is strengthened, the adverse effects can be minimised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think parents should but more toys for their kids or spend more time with them?<br>
There is no doubt that parental companionship is better for children than anything else. Children are always fond of new stuff. They easily get bored with the new toys which were bought by their parents a few days earlier. Obviously, parents cannot just keep buying new toys for their children. On the contrary, only the company of parents can make the children grow up healthily. For example, playing with the same toys with their parents, children can have more fun and interest than playing alone by themselves. Besides parents can teach their children some basic principles while they are playing together. Children need to communicate with their parents and it is better than playing alone with toys only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between the toys kids play with now and those they played with in the past?<br>
Because of the underdeveloped technology, children used to play with some toys and games in the past. Boys liked to play with plastic pistols, while girls played with dolls. Or they play hide-and-seek games together. All these games and toys were free or at a low price. However, for today's children, they start to play with mobile phones and iPads when they are little. For example, toys are also electrified or can talk. They play electronic games on iPads instead of playing outdoor activities with friends. Most of their electronic games and toys are expensive. The development of science and technology makes children's toys and games more and more advanced nowadays.</p>

<p>Why do so many young people choose communication and media studies as their major?<br>
On one hand, communication and media require lower scores, which is a shortcut to a good university for many students. This means they have more opportunities to choose their favourable schools with the scores they got in the College Entrance Exam. On the other hand, many students really like this profession. They like to show themselves in front of the camera, or even work behind-the-scenes in recording or production. They want to spread what they have seen and what they have heard to other people. This helps a lot of people see the world without leaving home. I have a good friend whose major is in hosting and broadcasting. I think it's a great major.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do young people find it hard to make career choices?<br>
Most young people don't know what jobs they like or are suitable for them at the beginning. First, it is because they don’t know what their own strengths are. For example, if you know you are good at math and interested in logic and reasoning, you are sure that a math-related field will be your future career choice. Secondly, young people often lack the opportunity and confidence to try anything unknown. So, they need to take part in more internships during their college. From sophomore year, they can visit different industries and workplaces in order to see and understand what these careers are related to. This helps them to understand what exactly they will work on in the near future if they choose these careers in the real society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can affect the career choices of young people?<br>
I think there are many factors influencing the career choices of young people. First, the salary must be the most important factor. After all, the income from work directly affects people’s enthusiasm for work after entering society. Secondly, family opinions can also influence people’s choices for their careers. For example, many children want to work in the government organisations because their parents like them to have stable jobs. The third, it is personal interest. Some young people would like to choose their jobs according to their hobbies. They do not mind what salary is, they only do whatever they are fascinated in. In general, young people's career choice is a comprehensive consideration of many aspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can people have free choices of their jobs?<br>
I don't think so. In today's China, many people can't have free choices of their jobs. Most people think that government officials and teachers are the best professions in China’s job markets. Practically, people have to ensure that they earn so they can afford what they spend. Especially, to be independent for living is the priority for most of the young people after they have graduated from their university. So, they cannot choose their dream jobs only according to their interest. Besides, there are a lot of limitations when people want to choose their favourable jobs. For example, the social connections, the majors, the job opportunities and even the situation of the economy in China are all the factors they might encounter.</p>

<p>Do people have more free time than those in the past?<br>
I think with the development of society, people have less and less free time nowadays. We have a lot of new innovations and applications to learn and to use. As a student, I am aware of the stress I have at school and after school. For example, I often go to my tutorial classes in my spare time. Even if I stay in the dormitory, I have to finish the homework and projects assigned by the teacher. There is very little leisure time that I could enjoy after school. I have some friends who are three years older than me, and they already have jobs. They told me that they often work overtime, from 9am to 9 pm, and work 6 days a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the difference between the things people did in their free time in the past and the things they do nowadays??<br>
When I was little, my parents had a lot of free time because they hardly needed to work overtime. My mom used to cook for all of us every day. During week days, my parents often took me to the park for a little walk after dinner. Generally, people had a lot of free time to accompany their families or do what they liked. However, nowadays people are too busy with their work every day. They have much less free time. With more and more work load and pressure, they have to work overtime more often than before. So, they seldom cook at home, but order meals online after work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do people like to do when they are free in your country?<br>
People at different ages have different hobbies. For students, we prefer to hanging out together for shopping, eating or singing at KTV when we have free time after school. It's boring for us to stay at home in our spare time. But for those who need to go to work from 9am to 5pm, or sometimes working overtime until 9pm, they're too tired after work. For example, my sister likes to stay at home, listen to music or play games on weekends. She often refuses to go out for dinner, and orders her meals online instead. For office workers, weekends are a rare free time for them to be relaxed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think most people are able to manage their free time well?<br>
Most people can't manage their time well, so success can only belong to a few people. I think good time management can greatly improve the efficiency of work; thus people get more free time in return. For sure, this requires great self-discipline. In addition, doing exercises, reading or singing are some of the good activities for people to do at their spare time. However, many people just complain that they are too busy at work, but spend all their free time playing games on their cell phones every day and night.</p>

<p>How do Chinese people celebrate their family events? Is there anything different from other countries?<br>
Eating out and drinking are two typical and traditional ways that Chinese people celebrate our family events. Eating and drinking can satisfy all the social interaction of Chinese people, including celebration, business, dating and so on. Chinese people like drinking, but they are different from other countries. Most Westerners celebrate with red wine and beer while Chinese people like white wine. And we do not have very strict table manners. We like to sit around, chat and laugh loudly in public or at home with our families. We do enjoy the happiness and excitement sharing with our family members in this way. Compared with other countries, Chinese celebrations are very distinctive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it important for sports fans to celebrate when their favourite team wins?<br>
I think that the favourite team for sports fans is normally their own city, or country team. When their favourite team wins, the fans will have a sense of honour. This is just like the Chinese will spontaneously support the Chinese National Team. When the Chinese team defeats the teams of other countries, I will certainly be proud that I am a Chinese. Besides sports fans have their own idol players in their favourite teams. They are fascinated by the sport stars, thus they would like to celebrate with their heroes together after the games. It is the way for them to express their love and excitement with the sport stars and their favourable teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people prefer winning in a team or on their own?<br>
This varies from person to person. I think most Chinese like teamwork. In Chinese culture, cooperation has always been respected. But for me, I prefer to my personal victory. Team work is important, but good team members are not easy to find. And it takes a long time to form a well-coordinated team according to my own experience. Thus, to me, my own success can build up my leadership ability. I can be aware of my own weakness in the competition with others. This makes me better and stronger in the future competitions and challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are birthday celebrations different between young and old?<br>
Young people often value their birthdays. They like to have birthday parties with families and friends to celebrate together. They love to exchange their presents at the parties. For young people, birthdays mean growth, and they think birthdays are the milestones in their life. For the older generation, like my parents, they don't like to celebrate their birthdays. It might because they have had a lot of birthday celebrations when they were young. Now while getting older and older, they just want to forget their ages. In addition, the older generation doesn't care whether birthday gifts are expensive or not. Even if they only received a birthday card, they are very happy and satisfied.</p>

<p>What kind of film is popular?<br>
I think comedy is more and more popular in China. First of all, comedy is suitable for people of all ages to watch, especially for the whole family to watch it together on holidays. But horror movies or science fiction movies have their limitations. Secondly, a lot of people work under great pressure at work and life, nowadays. It is a good way for people to decompress by watching a comedy together on weekends. What's more, many comedies nowadays actually contain some truth and reality. People can understand what the movies and the director exactly tell them after they laugh. This makes more and more people like to watch comedy in today's China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of film do young people like to watch?<br>
I think young people would like to watch romantic movies and science fiction movies. On one hand, each boy has a science fiction dream in his mind. Normally boys have better imagination, and they like the unknown, science fiction and mechanical elements. So basically, every boy would like to watch science fiction. On the other hand, girls may like to watch romantic and family movies. Since girls are more delicate, they would like to see the family movies and romantic love movies. Mostly, they prefer to see happy endings to the movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do fewer people choose to watch movies in cinema than people did in the past?<br>
I think fewer people choose to watch movies in cinema now. First of all, that is because the home audio-visual equipment is very effective now. While the size of the TV is getting bigger and bigger, and its sound is getting better and better. The feeling and the experience of watching movies at home is getting similar with that in the cinema. In addition, many movies are now available on the Internet after they are broadcast in the cinema, and the price is not as expensive. People can choose the time for watching. So instead of going out to the cinema, people would like to relax at home and watch the movies on a sofa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think cinemas will disappear in the future?<br>
I don't think so. First, although the home audio-visual equipment is becoming more and more advanced, it is still not comparable to the professional equipment of the cinema. For example, disaster movies and science fiction movies rely heavily on 3D special effects, and the feeling and experience of watching such movies in cinemas are much better than that of watching movies at home. Secondly, when watching movies at home, people are much more likely to be interrupted. Family members or phone calls will interfere with their concentration on watching movies. And people in cinemas are relatively orderly. They are all required to turn off their mobile phones and keep quiet. In general, going to the cinema is a social activity, especially for lovers and couples.</p>

<p>Describe a leisure activity you do with your family</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What leisure activities are popular in China?<br>
There are so many leisure activities that people can enjoy in China; it’s hard to name them all. People of all ages enjoy public dancing. You don’t have to be a good dancer to join in. Dancers of all abilities are welcome. It’s a wonderful way to enjoy the music and movement with friends and to meet new people! Playing Mahjong and walking in the park are also popular activities that people young and old enjoy. Some people enjoy keeping pets and will walk them in the park. None of these activities necessarily cost a lot money, but they bring people together so they can unwind from their stress while enjoying good company of others and being outdoors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What leisure activities do young people like?<br>
Young people tend to like more active leisure activities. Public dancing is active and certainly is popular, but so are activities like badminton and table tennis. There are plenty of opportunities to play in the park, but also at the local community center or in recreational leagues. There are always people available to play! Young people also like to go out with small groups of friends to do KTV on weekend evenings. It is a fun way to unwind after a long week of work or classes. Video games are also popular with young people, and while it isn’t very active, many find it a way to escape from daily pressures. I think video games are popular because if someone is in the mood to be alone or doesn’t have a lot of time, playing a video game for 30 minutes can be a good way to relax.</p>

<p>Do leisure activities have to be educational?<br>
Leisure activities don’t have to be educational, but they can be. My brother belongs to a chess club and he certainly has learned more about strategy and competition from being part of that. But I think that enjoying leisure activities benefits people in other ways that are equally important. Walking and dancing are great ways for people of all ages to be physically active which is good for their health, helps relieve stress, and improves the overall well-being of each individual because it keeps people socially active. Playing mahjong keeps people mentally engaged and socially active which is also good for people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do men and women like different leisure activities?<br>
Men and women can enjoy the same leisure activities, but often they have others that they prefer on their own. Both men and women seem to equally enjoy activities like public dancing, walking in the park, KTV, badminton, etc. But when I am in the park, I notice more men play jianzi than women. On the other hand, it seems more women enjoy doing some hand crafts like knitting, making lace, or candle making. That doesn’t mean that both men and women can’t enjoy the same activities, but it seems that sometimes they have less interest.</p>

<p>What indoor games do children like to play nowadays?<br>
Children seem to be spending a lot of time playing computer games indoors; there are even computer games designed for very young children! I think more and more computer games are considered educational and children have fun while they learn. However, children like to do activities like paint and draw inside too! They can spend hours playing with puzzles, tangrams, and building structures with building blocks like Legos when they are alone. However, kids still enjoy have a friend over and will play card games or even board games like checkers or mancala while they enjoy each other’s company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What qualities should a team leader have?<br>
A team leader has to be dedicated to the team goal, be able to communicate well with others, and most of all, have integrity. The team’s goals may change over time. It may be more reasonable for a team to have a smaller goal that needs to be achieved in order to reach a higher goal. The team leader has to believe in those goals and communicate them with enthusiasm and by encouraging each individual on the team. Further, the team leader has to have integrity and follow rules themselves while treating everyone else with equal fairness. These qualities will make others want to follow the team leader!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is teamwork important to individuals?<br>
Teamwork is a very important skill for individuals to learn and apply in their lives. Businesses are looking for employees who can work with others to solve problems. Everyone has a different strength. If you put different strengths together, you have a stronger team than if you are working alone. With cooperation between team members, they can solve challenges with more efficiency and confidence! Often, individuals think that their solution is the only solution, and perhaps it is. But if individuals communicate openly and listen to each other, they may find that there are other things that can be added to the original idea that will improve it. Then the team can share responsibilities to divide the workload and make it more achievable in a shorter period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think of people spending too much time playing computer games?<br>
I think spending too much time playing computer games is a waste of what could otherwise be productive time! I am not saying that playing computer games to relax is a bad thing, but the time has to be monitored. Nothing of real value is achieved by playing five hours of computer games. What could people do with four of those five hours that might be better for them mentally or physically? Perhaps they could be outside hiking which is better for their physical well-being. Maybe they could be meeting with friends and enjoy the social interaction. Perhaps they could be helping a neighbour, which is a satisfying thing to do and good for the community! So many choices for people unless they waste that time!</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Why do people lie sometimes?<br>
Most people are good, but sometimes good people lie. Usually, they lie because telling the truth would somehow hurt themselves or hurt someone else. Sometimes people lie because they don’t want to take responsibility for something that went wrong or to embarrass themselves. Occasionally, people would rather lie than to admit they don’t know the answer to a question. A “lie of omission” is not telling the whole truth. For example, telling your parents you walked your younger brother home from school, but not mentioning you stopped to buy ice cream cones along the way! I think the most common type of lie is the “white lie” when you don’t want to hurt someone else’s feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you define white lies?<br>
Like I mentioned, white lies are things people say when they don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings. Generally, white lies usually are told to be polite and are about topics that aren’t very important. Here’s an example. My friend was very proud of her new short, spikey haircut. I thought it looked like she had a sea urchin on her head! When she asked me directly how I liked it, I said, “It’s cute. I’ll bet it’ll be cool in the summer.” This lie fits the definition because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, I wanted to be polite, and frankly, how I really feel about her hairstyle isn’t important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it’s important to teach children to be honest?<br>
Definitely! Children need to learn that if they are honest, people know they are trustworthy. If they make a mistake or a bad choice and if they are honest about it, people will respect their honesty. If they lie about a mistake, no one will trust anything they say. It’ll take a long time before people will see them as trustworthy again. Even though I think it is very important to teach children to be honest, it’s also important to teach them to be polite and have manners. So, children also need to learn that telling white lies to be polite is not being dishonest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are other ways to teach children about honesty except having parents or teachers teach them?<br>
I think the parents and teachers are the primary influences to teach children about honesty, but there are other ways to reinforce this important lesson. There are many children’s book that address honesty. Nothing is better than to read a story when the main character makes a poor choice and then deals with the consequences of being dishonest with others. Perhaps asking a grandparent, or another trusted adult, to tell a family story about honesty in front of the child. This may lead to a discussion around the importance of being honest. I think the best way for children to learn is for the child to see other people around them being honest and truthful. They will want to model that behaviour.</p>

<p>What things do people often lose?<br>
People often lose small things, especially when they are in a hurry. They are usually things that they carry or use with their hands frequently. I think the most common items are keys, cell phones, purses, and gloves. This is because people use them and put them down. When they are leaving, they forget to pick them back up again before they go! Or sometimes people quickly toss things into their pockets and the items fall as they are walking. When I was little, I would wear mittens in the winter. I would put them in my pocket while I was playing, one of them would always fall out. I knew I had to stop playing five minutes early so I could look for it before I went home!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do people find the things that they lose?<br>
The easiest way is to re-trace your steps. That means, you think of the last time you saw it or used it, and then go everywhere you went after that! For instance, if I couldn’t find my cell phone in my house, I would think, “When was the last time I used it?” If I remembered that I texted a friend from my bedroom, I would go there and look. If I didn’t find it there, I would go to the next place I went after my bedroom until I would eventually find it. My mother has a device on her key chain so she can locate it with her cell phone. It has helped her a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you do to prevent from losing things?<br>
I try to put things in the same place, then I know where to look for things! For instance, when I come home, I put my keys on a hook by the door. It is a habit, everyone in the family does it. Also, I have a purse with a zipper on the top.If I use my cellphone when I am out, I put it back in my purse and zip it up so it stays with me. And a lesson I learned from losing many, many mittens is only putting my gloves in a deep coat pocket so they don’t fall out. Most importantly, I remember to look around me whenever I leave places so I don’t forget an item there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you do when you found the things that others have lost<br>
If I know who lost the item, I immediately text or call them so they don’t worry. Then we arrange for how they will get it back. If I don’t know who lost it, I think it depends on how valuable the item is. Once I found a ring on a bus. I knew it was valuable, so I posted an advertisement on the internet asking for owner to identify the engraving on the inside. The woman contacted me right away and was thrilled to get it back! If it isn’t as valuable as that, like a hat or umbrella, I would turn it in to the driver for the lost and found. That way the owner could retrace their steps and check with the bus to get their item back.</p>

<li>
<p>Are modern people happier than those who lived in the past?<br>
I think people living in the past were happier than those in the modern society. Back in the days, people really loved to communicate with each other face to face. They shared their happiness and excitement with each other more often by holding parties, celebrations and playing sports. And people also enjoyed shopping in the stores or malls during their weekends and holidays. However now, with the rapid growth of high technologies, people mainly communicate with each other and shop online. They have less opportunities for hanging out with friends, shopping in the stores with families, and meeting up with each other in person. More and more young people stay alone at home and chat only online with friends by typing on their cell phones or keyboards. They live in a virtual world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you like to have celebrations with? Friends or family?<br>
I would like to have celebrations with my family rather than friends. No matter what happens in my life, the people who stand by me and support me will always be my family. My parents encourage me when I am not confident in my studies or making new friends in school. So, whenever I have any celebrations, I would first like to thank my family for their support and encouragement. In my opinion, visiting with my friends is mainly about talking about fun and entertainment. Being with family means much more. You get to release the stress that’s been building in you, and tell your family what you are really feeling inside. You don’t have to hide any unhappiness or any ideas from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can money make people happy?<br>
Money plays an important role in people’s lives. We need enough money not only to make our daily living such as food, clothing, utilities, but also need money to pay for our entertainment. In this way, we have a better quality of life. And people obtain happiness through enjoying high quality of life. However, the happiness that money can bring is limited to certain level. Money will bring more trouble instead of happiness after a certain level. Psychological happiness can’t be obtained by money. Money does buy things that can make life easier and more comfortable, but if all someone loves is money, then they are greedy and their lives are always focused on making more money. By doing this, they miss the things that money cannot buy--like time with people you love, enjoying the cultural things around us, enjoying time doing hobbies that don’t revolve around making money. I think there has to be a balance to have a happy life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are some people unhappy nowadays?<br>
Today, with the improvement of social productive forces, people's material and spiritual needs are constantly changing. On the contrary, competition and challenges force people to give up their mental lives, but desperately work for their jobs, houses, and cost of living. This is the negative impact of materialism on the development of modern society. This makes some people feel more and more lonely and empty. Money, fame, and wealth are the factors which make some people feel like the barriers in their spiritual lives nowadays. So, the more they ask for, the less happiness they feel. With social economic development and improvement of people's living standards, people feel more and more spiritually lonely and depressed.</p>

<li>
<p>Which is more important? Preserving old buildings or building new ones?<br>
In my opinion, I think that preserving old buildings is much more important than building new ones. Most important is that it is crucial to retaining our nation’s heritage and history. If we demolish old buildings, the history will be lost. But, by restoring old buildings, people will be reminded of the history and it can be handed down to younger generations. Also important is the environmental impact. It is more practical to preserve older buildings because there is a large cost involved in demolishing them. Plus, the rubble will need to be recycled appropriately; and it reduces the need for as many new materials to rebuild it. There are many advantages to preserving older buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of old buildings do people like to visit in China?<br>
People like to visit older buildings with exceptional architecture that have been refurbished so their history remains intact, but with updated safety features like updated electrical wiring and structural repairs. Also, visiting a historical building that has been repurposed makes it interesting and practical. For instance, there is a building that had been used as a school at the turn of the last century a few blocks away from my home. When it was no longer able to accommodate the number of students, it was renovated to become a local community library. The outside architecture remained the same, but it was redesigned inside to include more natural lighting, places for books, computer labs, as well as cozy and quiet study areas. It’s a pleasure to go into the building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the most important to a public building? Design, location or facilities?<br>
While all three things are very important, without a question, the most critical thing is the facilities. The facilities represent and meet the needs of the community around it. A building can have a stunning design, but if no one needs the facilities and services provided within the building, no one will have a reason to go there. Location is also important, but if the facilities are in high demand by the neighbourhood, people would be happy to take a little more time to get to it to be able to use it as long as it isn’t too far out of the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think the appearance of a building is important?<br>
The outside appearance of a building is very important. It makes a significant statement about its purpose and what is inside. The entrance should be inviting, well lit, and easy to access. It should complement the structures around it. Having an attractive public building in the community gives the local people a sense of pride. People are happier. An attractive building is more appealing for local people to want to go there and to use it, so it may become more of a meeting place. Wouldn’t you rather go to an attractive building than an ugly one?</p>

<p>Should parents help their kids with their homework?<br>
Yes, I think parents should help their kids with their homework, especially if their kids are struggling to understand how to do it. I am not saying that parents should do the homework, but if parents help their child understand the homework, the child can go into school the next day feeling more confident. Also, some kids don’t want to do homework and having a parent present, if they are helping or not, will encourage them to work on it. This is a good way for parents to support a child’s education!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of advice should parents give to their children?<br>
Parents should give all kinds of advice to their children. Parents will always have their child’s best interest in mind when they give advice. Advice about values, moral decisions, friendship issues, school and career choices are all appropriate. Sometimes the best advice is to tell a child where to go for advice! I once had an issue that I shared with my mother and she was very honest when she said she couldn’t help me, but suggested I speak with my Aunt who knew more about the subject. Parents are a good resource for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should parents give children advice? Why?<br>
Without question, yes! It is important for parents to give advice to their children because they always want what is best for their children and want them to be successful. They have experience in the situations and decisions that their children need advice in. Parents can help their children thoroughly consider options when make choices so they do not make poor decisions. Parents don’t want their children to make decisions that can potentially cause hardship and will take time and effort to correct. It is so important that children go to their parents for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can kid provide any help to parents?<br>
Absolutely! Children are exposed to many new technologies and apps that they learn through school and their peers that can make their parents’ lives easier. Children can teach their parents about technology related things like new communication apps, good resources to find informational videos, and how to make online purchases more safely. Another way children can help their parents is by providing a new perspective on current issues that they may have learned about in school. Discussions between parents and their children can sometimes help parents see another side of an issue that they may not have thought about before.</p>

<p>What do you think is the best age children to go to school?<br>
I think 5 years old is a good age to start school. At five years old, children are comfortable being away from their parents in a secure setting and they want to be with children their own age. Children are able to sit and pay attention for longer periods of time at this age. The also have developed eye hand coordination so they would be able to start to learn how to write. I think most importantly, children are curious at this age and it is a perfect time for them to start to learn how to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer to study by yourself or with friends?<br>
I definitely prefer to study by myself. It takes me much longer to get my studying done when I study with my friends. Unfortunately, I am very easily distracted. Even if my friends don’t purposely distract me, even if they stand up or shift position, I look up. And if a friend wants to take a break for something to eat, I can never refuse! I prefer to find a quiet corner in the library, put my ear buds in, and study alone. That way I won’t even be distracted by friends or people walking by.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What quality do you think a good teacher should have?<br>
A good teacher should have in-depth knowledge of the subject he or she is teaching, as well as strong enthusiasm for the topic. Teachers who are enthusiastic about their subject present the information in a more interesting ways. They go into more depth and share additional facts because they know more about the subject. This encourages students to want to learn. My favourite classes have always been with teachers who are excited to share their enthusiasm for their subject. This enthusiasm becomes contagious because everyone in the class becomes excited by the subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you think can learn better, old people or youngster?<br>
I think young people have the advantage on learning new material. Often old people are not interested in learning new things unless it specifically relates to something they need to know. They may be set in their ways and be resistant to learn new concepts or ideas. Young people tend to have a broader interest base and are more curious about things, even if it doesn’t relate to something specific. Young people have also been learning regularly in school. It is a skill that they have been practicing currently. Older people have not been engaged in the learning process for many years!</p>

<p>Does weather have any impact on people’s daily activities?<br>
Weather has a very important impact on people’s daily activities. To begin with, the weather influences what clothing a person will wear for the day. If it is cold and snowing, people will choose much different clothing than if it is warm and sunny! People plan their outdoor activities around the weather. You will see more people outside in the park exercising, dancing, and even just socialising if the weather is pleasant. If it is raining or cold, more people will stay inside and plan indoor activities instead. Sudden inclement weather also forces people to change their scheduled activities at the last minute, for instance if there is a sudden rain storm, people might prefer to postpone a picnic until the sunshine returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people do different kinds of sports in different weather?<br>
Sports are usually played in certain seasons. This is because that season’s weather provides the best conditions to play the sport making it easier for the participants. Winter sports like skiing, snowboarding, figure skating, ice hockey, and sledding are best done when the natural weather is cold to provide the necessary snow and ice. Warm summer temperatures make water sports like swimming, diving, and surfing much more practical to do. The sports that generally involve a lot of running like soccer and field hockey are often played in the Spring or Fall because players aren’t dealing with extreme heat or cold and the playing fields are able to be maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of weather do Chinese people like?<br>
Chinese people like sunny, temperate weather. Weather that is not too hot and not too cold is perfect for just about any outdoor activity. And, sunshine brightens everyone’s attitude and is very welcome for people who may have been indoor at work or at school for several hours. Some Chinese people enjoy warmer weather common in the south or cooler in the north, but everyone enjoys the sunshine. Very few people enjoy the rainy season and no one enjoys the typhoons or severe snow storms which can create damage with unsafe conditions and disrupt everyday activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people talk about weather when they meet for the first time?<br>
Weather is something that everyone experiences together, so it is a popular topic that everyone has common knowledge about. Since, everyone experiences the weather in a common way, it is a way for people to start a conversation, especially when they don’t know what else they may have in common yet. Also, the conversations generally start in agreement, “Isn’t this weather beautiful?” This topic can encourage people to start to talk and speak politely with each other because the weather generally isn’t controversial. It is a good way to begin a discussion so people can get to know each other.</p>

<p>Why are people living in a community friendly with others?<br>
A community is a group of people who live near each other so it makes sense that they are friendly with each other. They see each other frequently, if not daily. Since they see each other so frequently, they tend to become friends, not just be friendly. They learn about each other’s families. They look after each other. Often when a member of the community is sick, others in the community will offer to help by bringing over food or help with childcare and errands. People will also celebrate life milestones together, like graduations or birthdays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are popular activities in a community?<br>
People who live in a community often share hobbies and do activities together. It is convenient to meet with people who live near you. Often people will meet at the community centre to play mahjong, ping pong or practice calligraphy. Since children will often know each other from the community or school, they will play together or meet in the park to play sports. People young and old enjoy meeting at the park and do Tai Chi or dancing. The nice thing about living in a community is there is always someone nearby who shares a common interest!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people like living in a community?<br>
Most people like living in a community. Usually, everything people need can be found within the community, e.g. access to public transportation, shopping, restaurants, etc. Not all people are friendly and outgoing, but everyone is courteous because they see each other regularly. Living near each other provides a multi-generational support system where people look after each other because they know each other and know if someone needs help. This is especially important when parents or children may not live locally. The best thing is people can always find someone with common interests, so no one needs to feel alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do people in the community usually have social gatherings?<br>
People can have small social gatherings at their homes or in a meeting room at their apartment building. Larger social gatherings are usually held at the community centre or in the park. The local community centre has several rooms available for meeting. Some of the rooms are set up for specific activities like mahjong, but other rooms are larger for less structured gatherings. Our community centre also has a gymnasium for people to exercise or play games like ping pong or basketball together. For very large gatherings, the park is perfect. People gather to dance, do Tai Chi, or even just enjoy being outside together.</p>

<p>What can governments do to improve people’s health?<br>
The government can do a lot of things to improve people’s health. They can provide educational public programs to encourage vaccinations against disease, healthy eating, and for people of all ages to be active. They also can create and enforce regulations to improve air quality, water quality, and other environmental concerns like mandatory recycling and deforestation. However, I think along with physical health, the government can be proactive with the mental health issues by encouraging elders to remain social and for communities to look in on elders and others who may suffer from isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What activities can schools organise for children to keep fit?<br>
Some schools already have structured exercise programs during the school day so children can be active and get some fresh air. Sometimes they will do calisthenics or play games. But I think schools could also include a course in healthy eating, stress reduction, and exercise into their curriculum. While I think this would be a good<br>
start, I also think having organised after-school programs offering a variety of sports or activities that children can try would also be beneficial. If kids like one, they will want to continue being active on their own!</p>

<p>How can you tell whether a website is reliable or not?<br>
If you look at the website, you can look to make sure the information is current, that it lists the author and that the author is qualified to write on the topic. Also, notice if the website is based on facts and not opinion, and if the purpose of the website is to inform others of facts and not to sell products or influence opinions. Another way is you can check information from the website is by going on a factchecking website. These websites ask questions to determine whether the information is correct or not. The results are then calculated and the website tells you whether your information is correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people are healthier now than in the past?<br>
Yes, people are healthier than they were in the past. People are living longer and are active later in their lives. I think it is because there have been many advances in science and medicine so people are making better choices in their own health. People are being vaccinated against diseases. There is a broader variety of foods available to eat and scientific research to help people know what foods to eat and, which ones to avoid, to improve their immune systems. People understand that stress reduction and enough sleep are important to a healthy immune system. People are definitely healthier.</p>

<p>Which do you think is more important; individual development or team’s goals?<br>
I think a team’s goals are more important and that people should design their own individual development plan based on the needs of their team. For instance, if my soccer team felt it was important to develop a stronger offences and the coaches felt the best way to do that was for players to improve their ball passing, I would be working hard practicing my speed and ball passing. If every individual works towards their team’s goals to the best of their ability, both the team and the individual will benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is good thing to have disagreements within a team?<br>
I think it is important to allow for disagreements within a team because differences will naturally occur within any group. Each person should have the right to voice their opinions and frustrations, but it has to be done in a constructive way, not a destructive way. If people are able to calmly discuss their differences, they will be able to find ways to compromise to resolve the problem. This way negative feelings don’t fester and get worse so that they start to affect the team’s performance. Once the problems are resolved, everyone’s attitude will improve and they will work better as a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is good for kids to join a team?<br>
When kids are young, they only think about their themselves, which is natural. This is why kids should be encouraged to join teams. When kids join a team, kids develop discipline, they learn to play by rules, and how to set personal goals for improvement. Most importantly, they learn to work together towards a common goal. There are many important life skills that can learned by being part of a team. These are skills that kids can use as they grow older in both school and later, in their careers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can a person become a good member of a team in the workplace?<br>
People have to work together in the workplace and be a good member of their team. It begins with people doing their own job in a timely manner and meeting deadlines. It also includes following the rules of the company like arriving on time and being prepared to work. It is important to have respect for your supervisors by working hard and respect for your co-workers by being courteous and offering help if needed. I think the most important way to be a good team member is to have a good attitude by taking pride in the company and have a willingness to learn more.</p>

<p>How do you like taking care of animals?<br>
Personally, I like animals, but I don’t particularly like to take care of them. If I had more time maybe I would enjoy it. But I am so busy with my studies and activities, I think it would become stressful. I take care of my neighbour’s cat when the family goes away. He’s a great cat and I don’t mind brushing him, but cleaning his litter box is unpleasant. I do have a pet fish that I like to take care of, but it doesn’t require a lot of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is safe for animals to live in the cities?<br>
It is only safe for animals if their owners take full responsibility for them. This especially means that animals need to be kept on a leash or in a fenced area when they are outside of their owner’s home. If they get loose, they can easily get disorientated by the amount of people and traffic in the city. They could get lost and then get hit by a car or die from hunger and adverse weather! People should not have animals as pets unless they can keep them safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the problems keeping pets will bring?<br>
Most of the problems are for the pet owner. The responsible pet owner should make sure that the pet is fed, properly groomed, is vaccinated against disease, and cannot run away. The more common problems tend to be making sure the pet has enough exercise, which means taking the pet for walks in the park on a regular basis. Also, to clean up after the pet when they ‘do their business’ during these walks. It is unhygienic and unhealthy for the entire community if animal feces is left on sidewalks or in the park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are pets different now than in the past?<br>
Pets in the past had more of a purpose to the family. Perhaps they were kept so they could herd other animals or act as a guard dog for protection, etc. Now pets are kept as companions and are often viewed as members of the household. They are often pampered and treated almost like they are part of the family. As I go over to my friends’ houses, I see their pets sitting on the furniture wearing very fancy collars. I laugh when I see them feed them food from their own plates. These pets are very spoiled and serve no purpose other than to entertain their owners!</p>

<p>Why should students wear school uniforms?<br>
I think it is a good thing for students to wear school uniforms because uniforms ensure that all the students look tidy and respectable. Wearing a school uniform teaches children to take pride in a serious appearance and teaches them valuable discipline skills. Therefore, a school uniform is not just an aesthetic decision, but one that improves the overall education of the students as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On what occasions should people wear uniforms?<br>
At school, students usually have both formal and everyday uniforms. Students will wear their formal uniforms to start the week on Mondays and on special school occasions like ceremonies. It is nice to wear uniforms for special occasions as a sign of respect. Many employers require their workers to wear uniforms daily when at work so people will be able to recognise their company by their colours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should companies ask for employees’ opinions about the design of uniforms?<br>
Frankly, I think they should because if the uniform is inadvertently designed without considering the employees’ responsibilities, the uniform could be a hindrance to their doing their job well. In a restaurant, would it make sense for a waitress or chef to wear high heels when they are constantly on their feet? Or for someone to wear long sleeves when they work in heated conditions? Yes, the uniforms may look nice, but they may not be practical. While I think management would be very thoughtful about the design process, it is good to have employees feel good about giving their opinions as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can people tell a person’s personality by his/her clothes?<br>
A person’s clothes can tell a lot about a person’s personality. If a person wears clothes with bright colours and flamboyant patterns, this person is probably very outgoing, wants to be noticed, and wants to be seen as an individual. People who wear mostly dark colours, are seen as conservative and more serious. People who take time to coordinate their outfits and wear clean, well pressed clothes are seen as people who care about their appearance and want to make a good first impression when they meet others. Clothes definitely make a statement about the person who is wearing them!</p>

<p>What kinds of products do young people think are useful but old people may not?<br>
I think young people think having and using the latest technology is more important than older people. For example, young people want the latest cell phones, but older people are happy with the older models because they do not feel they need the newer features. They just want basic features like having the ability to talk and text. They don’t want the upgraded cameras with special effects. Young people also want and need the latest technology on their computers like faster processors and increased battery life. Older people are used to their computers, and therefore, are more likely to wait to upgrade until they have to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think product instructions are useful for users to use products better?<br>
All products should have product instructions because they contain very valuable information for the product users. Sometimes the product instructions are very lengthy and many users don’t take the time to read the instructions. If they don’t read them, users may not know all of the features of their product and will not use it to its full capacity. The instructions also include warrantee information, troubleshooting information for common problems, and how to maintain the product. These are all very valuable things for the user to become familiar with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you usually do if you don’t know how to use the things you have bought?<br>
If I don’t know how to use something I bought, I start looking for help by reading through the instructions. If that does not help, I will look online for a video. Often, I can find several videos that will not only show how to use the product, but also give useful shortcuts from experienced users. Sometimes it is easier for me to learn from a video than reading the instructions. If neither the instructions nor videos teach me what I need to know, I will ask my friends to see if any of them own the product and can teach me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is necessary to produce many new products nowadays?<br>
I don’t think it is necessary to produce many new products because there is already an abundance of products available for people to buy. It just seems excessive to me. However, I think it is important to produce new innovative products. If a new product is truly innovative, it will fill a need that the people have and will be useful and welcomed. This innovation also encourages more development. Producing many new products just to have more products to sell is wasteful, but producing new innovative products is good for society.</p>

<p>Do you think parents should give kids challenges?<br>
Parents should give their kids age appropriate challenges because it is good for the children for many reasons. Children will learn critical thinking skills as they work through these challenges. If they have a problem with the challenge, their parents will be there to advise them and give suggestions. It is important for children to know that it is good to ask for advice from their parents. Finally, children will feel good when they are able to complete the challenge and will feel proud that they could please their parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What challenges do you think children might have to face up to?<br>
I think challenges change depending on what age they are. Young children who are three or four face the challenge of being able to entertain themselves for short periods of time. Children five or six are challenged by attending school for the first time and learning how to behave in a classroom and with a group of peers. As they grow, they face challenges like learning new social skills: how to be a good friend, how to work as part of the team, and in this age of social media, how to deal with cyberbullying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the most challenging thing for kids?<br>
The most challenging thing that kids have to learn is time management. If children can start to learn basic time management skills at a young age, it will help them as they get older and need to spend more and more time studying. Good time management helps students get better grades and reduces stress as they take on more responsibilities. Even though parents and teachers can tell children on good ways to manage time, it is up to the child to decide to do it. Only then, will children realise that it will help them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can parents reduce the challenges that kids have? why?<br>
The best way parents can reduce the challenges that kids have is to give them advice when they need it. Kids have to go through these challenges themselves. However, parents can help guide them so they do not feel additional stress or waste time by making unnecessary mistakes. It is important that parents have a good relationship with their children so that advice can be given and asked for without any resentment.</p>

<p>What kind of people do you usually see in the news?<br>
The news programs on TV usually have many different kinds of people. Certain kinds are seen repeatedly like politicians, sports athletes, celebrities, and entertainers. These are people that everyone recognises. Other kinds of people appear only once when the news has feature stories, like interviews with people who have survived fires or natural disasters or when they show pictures of missing people. My favourite stories are uplifting stories that include interviews with people who are doing good things for the community. These survivors, missing persons, and community volunteers are not people everyone would know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are stories about celebrities in the news always true?<br>
People have to be careful what they believe when they read stories about celebrities. I think some of the stories are true, but many are not. There is a lot of pressure for celebrities to be perfect all of the time and they have very little privacy. Photographers will follow them hoping to get an unflattering picture and make up a false story to go with the picture. This can be damaging to their career. Also, sometimes celebrities will stage a story for positive publicity. They will do something nice for others after they arrange for many people to be there to see it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is news often about famous people? Why?<br>
Famous people are often in the news because people are interested in knowing everything about them! People recognise these famous people and many identify with them; they want to dress like them and act like them. Since people are interested, news reporters want to write as many stories about famous people as they can. Because of this, even things that are not very important will be on the news. I recently saw a story about the clothes a celebrity was wearing when he brought his child to her first day of school. This wouldn’t be interesting if it were about anyone else but a celebrity!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could a superstar be a positive influence to the public?<br>
Superstars can be very influential and really help society because people want to be like them and share their values. Some celebrities support major social issues by donating their talent, time, and money. This often happens after a natural disaster so that the profits of one of their shows go to the people who are affected. Pop musicians may give a special concert and donate the profits. This not only provides money, but also draws attention to the need to support others after this disaster. Other celebrities are very vocal about social messages, like the importance of being drug-free and bringing awareness to the cyber-bullying problem.</p>

<p>What kinds of job do young people prefer?<br>
Most young people prefer office jobs in the city. It is an opportunity for young people to use their education in their jobs. It is mental work, so it would be challenging and mentally stimulating, and it could lead to advancement in their career if they do well. Also, the working conditions are good. The work would be indoors so there is heat and air conditioning, so employees are comfortable with the temperature. Generally, larger companies in the city also have programs and benefits for employees that make working there even more desirable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you prefer, physical work or mental work?<br>
I am not very strong, so I prefer mental work. Additionally, I think physical work may become too repetitive and I may get bored. But I find it stimulating and exciting when I have a task or problem that requires me to think hard and come up with a solution. I find mental work to be very rewarding and it fills me with good emotions. In contrast, I find physical work tiring and I am not very good at it. To be honest, I try to avoid as much physical work as I can!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What factors should people take into consideration when choosing jobs?<br>
There are so many factors people need to think about when they are choosing a job. To start with, is the person qualified to do it? It would be very bad to take a job and then be fired for incompetence! Another consideration is if the salary will be enough to live on, although someone might consider a job with less pay because they see a lot of advancement potential in the company. Other things to consider include how long is the commute time and what are the benefits that the company offers? For example, does the company provide training or additional education? Finally, will you enjoy the job?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people nowadays like to leave their hometown to work in other cities? Why?<br>
People like to leave their hometown to work in other cities for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is because they have gone to a university in a different city and their business contacts to find a job are in that city. Also, some young people feel it is part of growing up and living on their own. It shows they are truly independent from their parents. However, often it is because young people want to move and see another part of the country. Some people are just adventurous and want to experience a change.</p>

<p>What personal events do people usually celebrate?<br>
People like to celebrate special events starting from the birth of a baby and birthdays, to life milestones like graduations, weddings, and anniversaries. When my cousin accepted a job in another city, the family gave him a big “going-away” party. We weren’t celebrating his leaving us because we were going to miss him, but we wanted him to know that we were happy for him and his new career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do people celebrate their personal events?<br>
Most people I know celebrate with parties with their family and friends. Personally, I like big parties with many people, but some people prefer a smaller gathering of family and friends. Basic celebrations can be held at home or in restaurants and usually include food, drinks, and my favourite, cake and sweets! Big events, like weddings, are much more elaborate and expensive. At these events, there will be many choices of luxurious food available, music and entertainment, and it will be held at a special venue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much time do people need to prepare for celebration?<br>
For basic celebrations, like small birthday parties, sometimes people only have to plan for a few weeks to a month. That is enough time to make reservations at a restaurant or meeting space, invite people who would like to attend, and buy a gift. However, for major events, like a wedding or 50th wedding anniversary, it could take a year or more to make arrangements because there are so many more details than a basic celebration. And people need the additional time to save money so they can pay for everything!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is necessary to spend some money on celebrations?<br>
I think it is important to spend some money on celebrations, even if it is a small amount to make that day different from every other day. That’s what makes it a celebration. My mother wanted to celebrate her 40th birthday with just her immediate family having a picnic in the country. The small amount of extra money that we spent was on preparing special foods for the picnic. buying her favourite cake for dessert, along with the transportation costs to get to the picnic site. It wasn’t a lot of money, but it was the kind of celebration that she wanted and we wanted her to be happy!</p>

<p>What skills are important to be successful in business?<br>
People who are successful in business need to be hardworking, dedicated to their company, and able to communicate well with others. To be hardworking means to be punctual, have a good work attitude, get work done within required deadlines, and be willing to help colleagues in order for the company’s goals to be met! People who are dedicated to their company will be respectful of the rules of the company, as well as be respectful of their supervisors and their coworkers. Finally, the ability to communicate problems and solutions in writing and verbally is very important in today’s business world!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the differences between required skills in the past and those at present?<br>
Communication has always been important in business. However, in today’s business world, the ability to communicate with technology is very important. It allows customers to ask questions with a text or email and they expect a response very quickly! That is why the ability to use technology is so important. Now, people don’t have to dig through stacks of paper in file cabinets to find information about products, orders, and shipments. People who can learn technology and their company’s computer system, can find answers quickly with just a few keystrokes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of skills should successful people have?<br>
In addition to the skills I have already mentioned, I think successful people should also know how to identify problems quickly, analyse these problems for possible solutions, and choose the best solution. Problems always come up unexpectedly, but a successful person will have an idea when something isn’t going smoothly. Identifying potential problems early is a valuable skill. Going further from identifying the problem to actually solving the problem and implementing the solution will help people be successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think teamwork and communication skills are important? Why?<br>
Teamwork and communication skills are very important in today’s businesses! When it comes to problem solving, often people in a department will work together as a team. Everyone brings different strengths to the team and, hopefully, they will be able to communicate their ideas to the group so that the group can fully analyze the problem and then decide on the best solution. A person can be a genius, but if he or she cannot communicate ideas verbally when working in a team, it doesn’t help the team solve the problem! Others may find a person who cannot communicate well difficult to work with.</p>

<p>Where do people in China like to live, in a house or an apartment?<br>
Many people in China prefer to live in an apartment in the city. Apartment buildings usually have facilities that everyone can use. It is easy to get to know your neighbours and it promotes a sense of community. Also, these buildings are usually close to things people need like places to shop, parks, and public transportation so that commuting is easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the benefits of living in a house?<br>
There is much more privacy from your neighbours if you live in a house. It will be quieter because you will not hear anyone in the hall or dogs barking next door. You can be louder too, because you won’t disturb people who live around you! Another advantage is that there aren’t any rules about what you can and cannot do in the building. Some apartment buildings have rules like restricting the number of pets residents can own or their size. There are no restrictions when you live in a house and have your own yard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do many people like to live, in the city centre or the suburbs?<br>
The city centre is the a very popular place to live. It can be more expensive, but there are so many more things to do than in the suburbs. And most of these things are within walking distance! There are many more high-quality restaurants and places for entertainment and recreation. Also, people often work in the city centre so it is easier and quicker to get to their office. This is more time for people to spend with their families rather than commuting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do many people like to live in the city?<br>
I think the main reason is because there is so much to do in the city. So many good places to eat and be entertained! People often work in the city and there are many good schools are located there. So, living in the city means less time commuting to work and to school. There is no need for a car because if places you want to go are not within walking distance, you can get there very quickly through public transportation.</p>

<p>What is the difference between watching performance live and watching it on TV?<br>
There are advantages to both. If you are watching something on TV, you can “pause” it while you get something to eat and not miss any part of it or even record it and watch it again later. You can also be very comfortable lounging on a couch or chair. However, live performances are always so more enjoyable in person. It is fun to be part of the audience as everyone is waiting with eager anticipation for the performance to start. The lights, sounds, and audience add so much more to the performance. Watching it live is much more of an experience than watching it on TV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you prefer? Traditional performance or concert?<br>
I like concerts. The bands I like to see usually have exciting light shows as part of the concert. I like to hear the songs I enjoy so much being performed live and to see the groups sing them on stage. The singers will show their personalities by encouraging the audience to clap or sing lyrics that we all know. The music is loud and sometimes I think I can feel the music vibrate through me as well as hear it! It’s exhilarating!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should government provide financial support to promote traditional performance?<br>
I have mixed feelings about this. Traditional performances are so important to our culture, but I think private organisations should donate to encourage the study of traditional arts, as well as support the performances. I think people in society would respect these organisations more. However, if this isn’t happening, I don’t think the government has any choice but to provide financial support, because this part of our culture is too important to lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is learning drama or dancing helpful for children?<br>
Learning drama and dancing is very helpful for children! Drama promotes reading and memorisation skills. Dancing promotes coordination and is a healthy activity builds strength and stamina. Both drama and dancing promote discipline and hard work when learning these arts. Performing in front of an audience also helps children overcome fear of being in front of large group of people. These are also activities that children can continue to participate in as adults if they still enjoy it.</p>

<li>
<p>How do people usually go travelling?<br>
Most people use public transportation if their destination is within the city. If people are travelling to another city or a different part of the country, they will generally go by train because it is less expensive than travelling by air. Many people prefer trains because they are much more comfortable because passengers have more room and can walk around. Of course, if people are limited on time or need to go overseas, the best option is air travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what ways can traffic conditions in a city be improved?<br>
The best way traffic conditions can be improved is by not having as many vehicles on the streets. People need to be encouraged to take public transportation whenever possible. Additionally, maybe companies and schools could adjust their start times so that people who take their cars will not all be on the streets at the exact same time. In this way, maybe the traffic flow will be better. Finally, timing traffic lights to accommodate the busiest streets in the busiest times of day can also help improve traffic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people still drive a car if public transportation is free of charge?<br>
Unfortunately, many people will continue to drive their own car regardless of the cost. I think people are always in a hurry and do not want to wait for public transportation. Public transportation is very crowded during busy times and there can be delays. However, there is traffic congestion on the streets and that causes delays too, but some people prefer to wait in the comfort of their own vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can transportation in rural areas be developed?<br>
This is a difficult question, but having transportation options available for people in rural areas is very important. Perhaps the best way to start is slowly with one bus route daily from the rural area to the outskirts of the city where it can connect with the main public transportation system. As people realise this bus is available to them, more people will be likely to use it because it gives them more access to employment opportunities and other important services.</p>

<p>Which do you prefer, family firms or non-family ones?<br>
I prefer firms that are owned and run by families. They tend to be smaller than non-family firms and are more focused on products and services that the local community wants. Also, I think the customer service is more personal and reasonable in a family owned firm. Since their customers are all local, they want to make sure they have a good reputation and customers will go back!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are important factors in making a company successful?<br>
Price and quality of the product or service is very important. No one ever wants to overspend. But sometimes, I will spend a little more to buy from a company that is local or if I know it has a good reputation for customer 33<br>
service. The location of the company can be important for some goods and services. For instance, I always buy pastries from a bakery down the street because every time I walk by, I can’t resist stopping in!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of qualities should a successful businessman have?<br>
The most important quality for any person in business is good ethics. You have to be able to trust a businessman’s word and that he will do what he says he will do. Of course, a businessman needs to be knowledgeable and experienced in his field and to be a good communicator. A person can be very intelligent, but if they cannot communicate their ideas with others, it can be detrimental to their career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What emerging industries do you know?<br>
Most of the emerging industries that I know about are science based. Robotics is emerging and growing because it will be used more and more in the business world. Other industries include aerospace and satellite communications, as well as new energy vehicles and battery development for cleaner transportation . Finally, with the increase in internet communications, there is more focus in developing cybersecurity so we can work securely on our computers. There are so many new advances that will make everyone’s lives more efficient and productive!</p>

<h1 id="no-45-拥挤的地方">No. 45 拥挤的地方</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do people like to go to crowded places? Why?<br>
I don’t think people like to go to crowded places because often that means they have to wait for whatever they need. That’s why people try to plan to go when places aren’t as crowded. Fortunately, people become accustomed to crowds and plan for the additional wait time. An example of this is using public transportation during busy times. I know it will be crowded, so I plan a little extra time and then I don’t mind being in a crowded place. Everyone there is feeling the same way I am!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the problems of traffic congestion be solved?<br>
This is a complex issue, but I think the best way to relieve traffic congestion is to clear the roads of some of the vehicles. Improving public transportation is one way of encouraging people to leave their cars at home and use public transportation. Perhaps making costs around using cars more expensive would help. If gasoline was very expensive, the fees to own a car were high, and parking fees were very high perhaps less people would want to own one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people still like to live in big cities even though there are severe traffic jams?<br>
People like to live in cities primarily because that is where they work. Even with severe traffic jams, commuting time is still less than if they lived in the suburbs and needed to commute to work into the city. Plus, there are many other advantages to living in the city. There are more things to do during your free time. There are fine restaurants and more places to find entertainment. There are plenty of beautiful parks to enjoy open space. Living in the city definitely has its advantages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What public facilities does your city have?<br>
My city has more public facilities than I can mention, but my favourite is the park. There is something for everyone there. At the entrance, there is a large open space where people gather to dance and there are walking trails that go around the back of the park where you can feel quite alone. There is also a library right around the corner from me that has recently been renovated. It has a modern multi-media centre and several quiet areas with comfortable chairs to study in. We also have a community centre with meeting rooms and a gymnasium to play sports with friends.</p>

<p>What are the benefits of younger and older generations living together? How about the drawbacks?<br>
One of the best things about younger and older generations living together is that it is easy for them to take care of each other. My grandmother moved in with us when I was young and took care of me after school when my Mom was at work. As I grew older, her eyesight started to fail and I would read her favourite books to her. It gave us a chance to know each other well. Our house seemed smaller because we didn’t have a free bedroom anymore, but we respected each other and were able to live together without disagreements that some families have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you prefer, support from family members or friends? Why?<br>
While I like support from everyone, I know the people I can depend on the most are my family members. They always have my best interest in mind and have the experience to help me when I need it. They have generously financially supported me as I have gone to school. When I need advice or help making decisions, they are the first ones I speak with. I can always depend on my family having my back!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many generations does each family have?<br>
My family has three living generations: my grandparents, my parents, and me. Some families are lucky enough to still great grandparents who are still alive so they have four generations! I suppose it is possible to have five generations in a family, but I don’t personally know anyone who is that fortunate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it important to visit family members? Why?<br>
It is vital to visit family members. Grandparents love talking about their past and it gives young people a chance to know them and know the family traditions. My grandfather enjoys teaching me his favourite hobby, calligraphy. He keeps encouraging me even though we both know I am not very good at it. But it gives us a chance to be together and enjoy each other’s company. These visits also help prevent loneliness and keeps families close, especially if everyone doesn’t live locally.</p>

Yes, because people can easily abuse them and, knowingly or unknowingly, harm other people. There need to be laws about talking and texting on the phone when driving, which endangers everyone around that driver because he or she is distracted from looking at the road. Also, some young people will use their cell phone inappropriately on social media and there has to be laws about cyberbullying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you like children having mobile phones?<br>
It really depends on how young they are. I feel sad when I see a group of preteens standing in a group and all of them are staring at their phones instead of talking with each other. I understand that mobile phones are very common, but I think children should know that while mobile phones will have apps and tools for better communication, they don’t replace talking to the people around you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At what age should children have mobile phones?<br>
I think children are responsible enough for a mobile phone by the age of 13. Mobile phones are expensive and they need to be able to take care of it and not be careless or forgetful. Also, by that age, they begin to need it more for school. There are several apps that would be helpful for them in school and while doing homework. Further, children are more independent by 13 and need a way to remain in contact with parents and friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are people politer now than in the past?<br>
No, I don’t think so. While most parents are very good about teaching good manners, I think many people are distracted by technology and do not follow the same polite behaviours that were considered normal in the past. How many people have you seen walking down the street intently looking at their phone and not looking up? Even perhaps bumping into others? Or people who have been listening to music with their ear buds in and are not looking up? In the past, these same people walking down the street would be smiling, nodding, and saying, “Hello” as they walk by others, but not in today’s society.</p>

<li>
<p>Do you think traditional letters are a good way to send messages?<br>
Traditional letters are a good way to send messages to my grandparents, but no one else! Email, texting, and even faxes are quicker and more direct way of communication. Most messages have some urgency and a purpose to them, so getting the message to the right person in a timely manner is important. Messages can get to the recipient through electronic means in a few seconds, rather than several days. My grandparents consider the letters I send them “keepsakes” because they enjoy seeing the development of my penmanship!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do people make phone calls instead of sending messages when there is something important?<br>
Phone calls are more personal than sending a message and you know the person has received the information you wanted them to have. People can respond to each other instantly and clear up any confusion that can sometimes happen with electronic messages. Also, if the message is urgent, you know that message isn’t waiting in their email unopened. When the call is about something very important, personal interaction is a much better way to communicate so you can make sure that the person you called heard and understood the message in its entirety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it more polite to make phone calls than send text messages?<br>
I don’t think that is true in today’s society, but it may be true in some cases. Businesses will text me when my order is ready. My airline will text me if my flight is delayed. And I am not offended at all! I would rather read a quick text than be called or listen to a voice message. My friends all prefer texting to phone calls. However, the only exception I can think of is my grandparents might be upset if I texted them rather than called them. They have trouble reading the texts on their phone and will often just ignore them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does technological development have a negative impact on communication among people?<br>
I think it creates a different type of communication, some of it is positive, but some of it is negative. Technological developments have allowed people to keep contact with people who have moved. This is a good thing because these are people who may have been forgotten. The negative impact is that communication with current acquaintances can become superficial. Instead of taking the time to personally interact, which allows people to truly get to know each other better and become friends, people will briefly interact electronically. Also, people can be so focused on their phones, they do not even notice the people physically around them!</p>

<h1 id="no-49-乘公共交通工具旅行">No. 49 乘公共交通工具旅行</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In what ways can we fix traffic problems?<br>
I think we can fix traffic problems by encouraging others to use public transportation. I think public transportation keeps private vehicles off the road and obviously less vehicles on the road means less traffic. I also think that we can help the traffic problem by scheduling our errands appropriately. If we're able to do several errands at one time, I think that's less trips out of the house and less trips on the road and that also will help with the traffic congestion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it fair to limit the use of private cars?<br>
I think it's fair to limit the use of private cars. I think it's good to encourage the use of public transportation and if you have private cars, you're going to use them to be driving and that's going to contribute to the traffic problem. I think people can use private cars if they're going places where public transportation doesn't go, but that's not usually the case. Our public transportation system is very adequate, and it generally takes us wherever we need to go. Private cars are a luxury and they should be used as luxuries, not as a means of daily use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should governments encourage people to use public transportation?<br>
I think government should encourage people to use public transportation. I think that's the only way around the traffic problem. How they do that is a different story. Do they encourage them to use it by limiting private cars or do they have a public relations campaign to encourage the use of it? I think it's important that the government supports those people who use public transportation and in doing so hopefully this traffic problem will be lightened somewhat, if not resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the most popular means of transportation in your country?<br>
Public transportation is very popular here. We have a bus system, as well as a train system. Both are very adequate. They take us wherever we need to go the only thing is we have to somehow change our schedule to meet what times the buses or trains are running. It's not always exactly when we want to go, but very quickly you learn how to adjust your schedule so that it's easier to get from here to there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer public or private transportation? Why?<br>
Private transportation really is a luxury and it's nice when you indulge in that luxury, but I know that public transportation is much better for everybody. I think it's excessive if everybody uses private transportation because I see the environment as a very important issue and I don't like to see air quality go down. I do like to use public transportation at every opportunity that I can and it would be really nice if everyone else did as well.</p>

<h1 id="no-50-某人给我道歉的经历">No. 50 某人给我道歉的经历</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On what occasion do people usually apologise to others?<br>
People will apologise to others when they have done something to hurt or inconvenience others. For instance, if someone said something that unintentionally hurt someone else, apologising is the best thing to do. If a person is late when meeting someone, it is appropriate to apologise for not being punctual. Apologising helps people to begin talking again so they can repair their relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people in your country like to say “sorry”?<br>
Yes, they do. If someone accidentally bumps into you, they will say, “sorry” or “excuse me” and that’s fine. But people who have a hard time apologising will give this shortened version of an apology which I don’t think is good manners. If someone is late, I think they should say, “I am sorry I am late” rather than a brief “sorry”. To me, an apology sounds more sincere when it is used in a complete sentence!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people should apologise for anything wrong they do?<br>
I think if people feel sorry for something they have done that is wrong, they should apologise. Otherwise, their relationship with the other person could remain damaged. If someone said they were going to meet me at a movie theatre and didn’t come, then she never mentioned it to me, I would be hurt. The only way to start to repair that is with an apology. On the other hand, if people do not feel sorry for what they have done, they should not apologise because that is a lie and people shouldn’t lie to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do some people refuse to say “sorry” to others?<br>
Some people have a hard time accepting responsibility for things they have done wrong. It is easier for them to blame other people than admit they are the ones who are wrong. They might say, “I wouldn’t said that if she didn’t say something first.” Others feel that sometimes things aren’t important enough to apologise for and only feel they need to apologise for what they consider to be important things. They think that the other person is over-reacting. I don’t really understand why saying these two words, “I’m sorry” can be so difficult for some people, but I don’t think it is healthy for them.</p>

<li>
<p>Do people in your country set goals?<br>
Some people in my country set goals, but some don’t. People who are successful always set goals because it gives them something to work towards. It gives them direction in their lives for things they want to achieve and things they feel will make them proud and happy to have accomplished. Their goals are well defined and include specific, measurable results achieved within a specific timeframe. I think people who do not set goals tend to live life day by day and may not feel the same purpose in their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do people usually set long-term goals or short-term ones?<br>
People usually set one or two long-term goals and then set several short-term goals to help them reach these long-term goals. It’s easier to achieve the big goal by breaking it into smaller, more achievable goals. Each time a short-term goal is met, a person stays motivated by knowing that they are closer to achieving their long-term goal. Another reason there are more short-term goals is because many are unrelated to the long-term goal, e.g. finishing my studying early on Saturday so I can go out with my friends on Saturday evening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is setting goals important in the workplace?<br>
Setting goals are vital in the workplace. Goals provide a direction for the company for how they intend to be more successful. These goals can be short term, like monthly sales and production goals and long-term goals like growing their market share to 25% in ten years or build a second manufacturing facility. Not only are goals good for the business, they are important for employees too. They let the employees know what they need to focus on in the upcoming year. They keep employees motivated and provide a basis for pride when goals are achieved!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between goals set by old people and young people?<br>
Young people are at the beginning of their lives and, because of that, they will set more long-term goals than old people. These goals will be about their education, careers, and what they want to do with their lives. The older people get, the more they have already accomplished in their lives. Their formal education and career goals are now in their past. They will generally set short term goals with flexible completion dates, for example, learning a new hobby that they have more time for now that they are retired, or personal weekly goals like swimming three times per week or volunteering weekly at the local schools.</p>

<h1 id="想和朋友探讨的电影">想和朋友探讨的电影</h1>
<p>Describe a film you would like to share with your friends<br>
You should say:<br>
Where you watched it<br>
What it was about<br>
Who you watched with<br>
**And why you want to share it with friends</p>
<p>I’ve been watching quite a lot of movies for the past month, since I had some free time on hand. Out of all the movies that I’ve watched, there was one movie that I couldn’t stop talking about, and I’ve shared it with many friends – it’s Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse.<br>
I saw the preview of the movie a few months before it was released. It was about how Spiderman saved the world with his friends. I asked one of my best friends, Michelle, to go watch it with me when it came out. We went to the closest cinema to our school and watched it on the premier day. After watching the movie, I found it very interesting to me. Whenever a friend asks me about a good movie, I would recommend this to her.<br>
In general, there are so many reasons why I suggest for my friends to watch this movie. Right off the bat, the animation in this film was incredible, especially when Spiderman was seen in recent years. Another one of the great things about this movie is that it conveys an idea of helpfulness and a sense of justice. Not only can the superhero save people in danger, but everyone in the world also has the power and obligation to help others when they are in need. Also, it is suited for all kinds of audiences. Kids will like it; adults will also enjoy it too. So, it is a good movie that is worth recommending to my friends.<br>
中文思路:<br>
自从有点空闲时间，上个月我看了很多电影。在所有看过的电影中，有一部让我爱不释手，我把它分享给了很多朋友——他是《蜘蛛侠:平行宇宙》。<br>
这部电影上映前几个月我看了预告片。这是关于蜘蛛侠和他的朋友拯救世界。我请我最好的朋友米歇尔 和我一起去看这部电影。我们去了离我们学校最近的电影院，在首映日看了这部电影。看完电影后，我 觉得这部电影非常吸引我，每当有朋友问起好看的电影，我都会推荐它 总的来说，我有很多理由推荐这部电影给我的朋友。它的动画效果令人难以置信，这是我近年来看过的 最好的科幻电影。这部电影的另一个伟大之处是它传达了一种帮助和正义感。超级英雄不仅能拯救处于 危险中的人们，而且世界上的每个人都有能力和义务在别人需要的时候帮助他们。而且，它适合各种各 样的观众。孩子们会喜欢它，成年人也会喜欢它。所以，这是一部值得与我的朋友分享的好电影。</p>
<h1 id="庆祝成就">庆祝成就</h1>
<p>Describe an occasion when you celebrated your achievement<br>
You should say:<br>
What you achieved<br>
How you celebrated it<br>
Who you celebrated it with<br>
And how you felt about it</p>
<p>While talking about an occasion for celebration, I was very impressed by the one that my parents celebrated for me after the college entrance examination.<br>
After I had studied very hard for a year, I was admitted to my favorite, Nanjing University, which is very famous in China. My parents were proud of me and held a celebration for my achievement. I invited my high school teachers and friends.<br>
We had a banquet at the best restaurant near my home. A bottle of champagne was always a good way to start an occasion with family and friends. We ate and drank together, cheering my success and sharing happiness with each other. Everyone congratulated me for being admitted to such a good university, and I felt extremely proud of myself at that moment. At the end of the banquet, we took pictures together because we would like to remember this wonderful moment with our high school teachers and friends. This was also the last chance for me to say goodbye to my high school time and to be ready for my university study.<br>
In general, when you put in a lot of effort and get the reward, you should feel proud. I really appreciate my parents and teachers. And I understand that their strictness with me was to make me better. To me, the banquet was not an occasion to celebrate my achievement, but it was the moment to look back and be thankful to everyone at the banquet who helped me in the past years.<br>
中文思路: 在谈到一个庆祝的场合时，我对我父母在高考后为我庆祝的时刻印象深刻。<br>
在我努力学习了一年之后，我被我喜欢的南京大学录取了，这所大学在中国非常有名。我的父母为我感到骄傲，并为我办了一场庆功宴。邀请了我的高中老师和同学。<br>
我们在我家附近最好的餐厅举行了一次宴会。与家人和朋友聚会时，喝瓶香槟总是一个很好的开始。我们一起吃喝，为我的成功欢呼，分享快乐。每个人都祝贺我被这样一所优秀的大学录取，那一刻我为自己感到无比自豪。在宴会的最后，我们一起拍照，因为我们想要记住与老师和朋友在一起的美妙时刻。这也是我告别高中时光的最后一次机会，并为大学生活做好准备。总的来说，当你付出了很多努力并得到了回报，你是值得骄傲的。我非常感激我的父母和老师。我明白他们对我的严厉是为了让我变得更好。对我来说，宴会不是庆祝我的成就，而是回顾过去，感谢宴会上<br>
的每一个人在过去几年里帮助我。</p>
<h1 id="读书写字的地方">读书写字的地方</h1>
<p>Describe a place where you read and write (not your home)<br>
You should say:<br>
Where it is<br>
How often you go there<br>
What it is like<br>
And explain how you feel about this place</p>
<p>When I think of my school classes and lessons, I feel a lot of stress. So, after school, I would like to find a quiet and peaceful place for me to study. A little park near my home is the perfect place for me to read and write because there are lots of trees and flowers in the park, but few people know about it.<br>
My home is in the suburb of Guangzhou, where I can enjoy that fresh air. So every day after school, I like to go directly to the park alone before going home. I make myself comfortable on a park bench and open my book. It feels like all of my stress leaves me as I start writing my homework on the stone table. At weekends, when I am reading alone, I would look up from my book to watch people as they walk by me. This makes me appreciate my afternoon even more because I can see different people than only the teachers and students at school.<br>
In general, this park is little, but the perfect place for me to have my own space and enjoy my freedom. In this way, I can escape from my parents’ supervision. The solitude of reading and writing alone in the park is very pleasant. In particular, sitting in the park, breathing the fresh air and smelling the green trees makes me feel calm and refreshed. I enjoy watching the colourful sunset while walking the long way around the park to go home.<br>
中文思路:<br>
当我想到我的学校课程，我感到压力很大。所以，放学后我想找一个安静的地方学习。我家附近的一个 小公园是我读书写字的好地方，因为公园里种了很多花草树木，而且很少人知道这地方。 我的家在广州郊区，在那里我可以享受到新鲜的空气。所以每天放学后，我想在回家之前直接一个人去 公园。我舒服地坐在公园的长椅上打开书。当我开始在石桌上写作业时，我感觉所有的压力都离开了我。 周末当我一个人看书的时候，我会从书中抬起头来，看着人们从我身边走过。这让我更加珍惜我的下午， 因为我可以看到不同的人，而不仅仅是学校的老师和学生。 总的来说，这个公园很小，但对我来说是一个拥有自己空间和享受自由的完美的地方。在这里我可以逃 避父母的监督。一个人在公园里读书写字的孤独是很令人愉快的。特别是坐在公园里，呼吸新鲜的空气， 闻一闻绿树，让我感到平静和神清气爽。我喜欢一边看五彩缤纷的日落，一边绕着公园走很长一段路回 家</p>
<h1 id="初见时刻">初见时刻</h1>
<p>Describe a time when you first met someone<br>
You should say:<br>
Where you met him or her<br>
When you met him or her<br>
What you talked about<br>
And how you felt about</p>
<p>I had quite a lot of friends when I was in high school, but Melody was the most interesting person I have ever met in my school.<br>
I first met Melody in art class which was the first lecture I took in university. It was a mandatory class (必修课), so not a lot of people were interested in it. And nobody seemed to be paying attention to the teacher.<br>
I first noticed Melody because she was really engrossed on taking notes on her notebook while listening to the teacher’s lecture. She drew my attention at that moment because I had never seen any classmates so focused on the art lecture like she was. So after class, I went up to her and started chatting with her. Through our conversation, I learned that Melody was really keen on game development, and she had always been dreaming of making her own game company someday. She listened to art class so carefully because she wanted to learn how to draw her own graphics in the game.<br>
She was really talkative about this subject, and told me a lot of game ideas and designs that she’s working on. I was fascinated by her unique and interesting ideas of game development, so we became very close friends. To be honest, her game ideas are really one of a kind, and I sincerely believe that her game will shine once it gets released.<br>
中文思路: 我在高中的时候有很多朋友。但是梅洛迪是我在学校里见过的最有趣的人。 我第一次遇见梅洛迪是在美术课上，那是我在大学的第一节课。这是一个选修课,所以并不是很多人都对 它感兴趣。而且似乎没有人注意到老师。<br>
我第一次注意到梅洛迪是因为她在听老师讲课的时候非常专注于在笔记本上涂鸦。那一刻，她引起了我 的注意，因为我从来没有见过像她这样专注于艺术讲座的同学。所以下课后，我走到她面前，开始和她 聊天。在我们的交谈中，我了解到 Melody 非常热衷于游戏开发，她一直梦想着有一天能创建自己的游 戏公司。她非常认真地听美术课，因为她想学习如何在游戏中画自己的图形。 她对这个话题非常健谈，并告诉我许多她正在研究的游戏理念和设计。我被她独特而有趣的游戏开发理念所吸引，所以我们成为了非常亲密的朋友。说实话，她的游戏理念真的是独一无二的，我真心相信她<br>
的游戏一经发布就会大放异彩。</p>
<h1 id="很累却要保持清醒">很累却要保持清醒</h1>
<p>Describe a time that you were sleepy but had to stay awake<br>
You should say:<br>
When it happened<br>
Why you were sleepy<br>
Why you had to stay awake<br>
And how you stayed awake?</p>
<p>When I think of my last year at high school, I still remember how hard I studied day and night for the College Entrance Exam.<br>
As well known, the Exam is very critical for each of our senior students in the secondary school. We started to prepare for it at least a year ago. Since we had classes during the day, I still often studied late every night till the early morning. Sometimes I could only sleep six hours a day, so I often felt sleepy.<br>
I could not forget the day before our last final exam, my physics teacher suddenly gave us a lot of homework. It was impossible to do the homework and review for the exam within a day, I knew I had to stay up late to finish them.<br>
In the evening, I had been reviewing until 1:00am. I was too sleepy to concentrate on the book. But I knew that I could not go to bed at that time if I wanted to do a good job in the exam. So, I made a cup of coffee to refresh myself. The effect of caffeine really made me feel much more alert. I cheered up and continued to review the book till three o'clock in the morning.<br>
In general, it's really hard for me to stay awake when I'm terribly tired because I used to sleep at least eight to nine hours a day. However, when it's necessary to devote myself to something important for my study and future career, I can stay awake even though I am very sleepy.<br>
中文思路: 当我想起我在高中的最后一年，我仍然记得我如何努力学习，为高考日日夜夜。 众所周知，考试对我们每一个高中生来说都是非常重要的。我们至少一年前就开始准备了。由于我们白 天上课，我经常学习到很晚，直到凌晨。有时一天只能睡六个小时，所以我经常感到困倦。 我不能忘记在我们最后一次期末考试的前一天，我的物理老师突然给了我们很多家庭作业。要在一天之内完成作业和复习考试是不可能的，我知道我必须熬夜完成它们。晚上，我一直复习到凌晨一点。我太困了，无法专心看书。但是我知道，如果我想在考试中取得好成绩， 我就不能在那个时候睡觉。所以我冲了一杯咖啡来提神。咖啡因的效果真的让我感到很兴奋。我振作起 来，继续复习这本书，直到凌晨三点。 一般来说，当我非常累的时候很难保持清醒，因为我过去每天至少要睡 8 到晚上。然而，当我需要为我 的学习和未来的事业投入一些重要的事情时，我可以保持清醒，虽然我很困。</p>

<p>Describe a toy you liked in your childhood<br>
You should say:<br>
What it was<br>
When you got it<br>
How you played it<br>
And explain how you felt about it</p>
<p>When it comes to a toy that I liked in my childhood, I would like to talk about my toy cellphone. It is a gift which mother gave to me on Christmas Eve. Even though it was not so expensive or beautiful, it contained a lot of my memories of childhood and my parents’ love.<br>
My mother always told me the stories about Christmas when I was young, so I was a big fan of Santa Claus. Once she told me Santa Claus would come to our town and climb into our home from the chimney and he would leave me a gift beside the dinner table. So, I rushed to living room and surprisingly found that there was a cellphone on the table! The special gift I got from Santa was that toy cell phone. The moment I opened the gift box, I was so excited and jumped up high because it was a cell phone that I was longing for to have for a long time.<br>
I picked up the phone and said “Hi Santa!”. To my surprise, there was a male voice answered, “Ho Ho Ho...” I was overjoyed by hearing this voice and I never forgot it for so many years even though my belief in Santa dropped off the following year. After hearing this pleasant story my mom told me, I came to understand the “voice of Santa” was actually from my Dad. This was a toy cell phone with recording function. My father surprised me by recording the voice of Santa Claus in advance.<br>
中文思路:<br>
说到我小时候喜欢的玩具，我想谈谈我的玩具手机。这是妈妈在平安夜送给我的礼物。虽然它不是那么昂贵或美丽，它包含了我童年的许多回忆和我父母的爱。<br>
当我小的时候，妈妈总是给我讲圣诞节的故事，所以我是圣诞老人的超级粉丝。有一次，她告诉我圣诞 老人会从烟囱爬到我们家，他会在餐桌上给我留一份礼物。所以，我冲到客厅，惊讶地发现桌子上有一 个手机!我从圣诞老人那里得到的特别礼物是那个玩具手机。当我打开礼盒的那一刻，我非常兴奋，跳得 很高，因为这是我渴望已久的手机。 我拿起电话说:“嗨，圣诞老人!”令我惊讶的是，竟然有一个男性的声音回答道:“嗬嗬嗬......”我听了这个 声音欣喜若狂，多年来从未忘记，尽管我对圣诞老人的信仰在最近有所下降。在听了妈妈给我讲的这个 愉快的故事后，我开始明白“圣诞老人的声音”其实是来自我爸爸，这是一个有录音功能的玩具手机，爸 爸提前录好了圣诞老人的声音来给我惊喜。</p>
<h1 id="与陌生人的对话">与陌生人的对话</h1>
<p>Describe an interesting conversation you had with a stranger<br>
You should say:<br>
Who this person was<br>
What the conversation was about<br>
Why you had this conversation And how you felt about it</p>
<p>Normally during the summer vacation when school was finally over, I used to have tons of free time to hang out with my friends. However, this summer, all of them had packed schedules somehow. I ended up all alone without friends to have fun with.<br>
One day when I found an anime-themed café online, I decided to go there alone. However, when I arrived at the café, the waitress told me that all reservations were full, so I had to share one table with another girl who was also alone.<br>
As I sat down, I greeted the girl who was sitting across from me. Her name was Jenny, and she also came alone. I surprisingly found that she had a lot of similar hobbies as me, such as anime, novels, and movies. We commented on the café’s decoration and its food. We both enjoyed the same taste and kinds of foods. When we talked about the anime, both of us loved drawing anime characters whenever we were free. Besides we also loved to see the same movie “A Dog’s Journey” because both of us are fans of Henry Liu.<br>
It was a nice place for a cozy chat and a cup of coffee. And it was a very interesting conversation because it is hard to meet strangers that have so many similar interests as mine. Jenny was an interesting and humorous person to chat with because she made lots of funny references as she talked. Even after the coincidental encounter at the café, I’m still in contact with her to discuss our hobbies together.<br>
中文思路:<br>
通常在暑假期间，学校都放假了。通常我有很多空闲时间和我的朋友出去玩。然而，这个夏天，他们的 日程都排得满满的，不知怎么的，最后只剩我一个，没有朋友一起玩。 有一天，当我在网上找到一家以动漫为主题的咖啡馆时，我决定一个人去。然而，当我到达咖啡馆时， 服务员告诉我所有的预订都满了，所以我不得不和另一个女孩共用一张桌子，她也是一个人。当我坐下 时，我向坐在我对面的女孩打招呼。她叫珍妮，也是一个人来的。我惊奇地发现她和我有很多相似的爱 好，比如动漫、小说和电影。我们评论了这家咖啡馆的装修和食物。我们都喜欢相同的味道和类型的食 物。当我们谈到动画时，我们都喜欢在有空的时候画动画人物。此外，我们还喜欢看同一部电影“狗的旅 程”，因为我们都是刘亨利的粉丝。 这是一个聊天和喝咖啡的好地方。这也是一次非常有趣的谈话，因为很难遇和我有这么多相似之处的陌 生人。珍妮是一个有趣又幽默的人，因为她说话的时候引用了很多有趣的东西。即使在咖啡馆偶遇之后， 我仍然和她保持着联系，一起讨论我们的爱好。</p>

<p>Describe a school you went to in your childhood<br>
You should say:<br>
Where it was<br>
What it was like<br>
What you learned there And how you felt about it</p>
<p>When I was a child, my parents moved from Guangzhou to Shanghai because of their work requirements. I was seven years old when we moved to Shanghai, and I was enrolled into a public elementary school near our home. Shanghai Eastern Elementary School was located in Pudong Economic Zone. There were about 500 students and about 50 teachers in the school. Even now, I still remember it was surrounded by a little park and some apartments. The school concentrated much more on English learning than the other school nearby.<br>
At first, when I entered the school, I was a little timid, but my home room teacher (班主任) noticed me, and helped me merge in with the class. His name was Mike, and he taught us English. He was really nice and funny. He always took us to the school library to read and listen to some original English books. He was so eager to answer our questions all the time. To be honest, we were able to learn a lot of vocabulary and grammar from him. Mr. Mike used to tell us: if we wanted to learn something, we should have strong interest in it to motivate ourselves when learning.<br>
In addition, my class was friendly and teeming with positivity. This made me eager to study harder with my classmates. I learned that it’s really important to have positivity in your learning environment to gain motivation for studying. Nowadays, whenever I think of my nice teachers and diligent classmates, I miss my elementary school.<br>

当我还是个孩子的时候，我的父母因为工作的需要从广州搬到了上海。我七岁搬到上海时，我被附近的 一所公立小学录取了。上海东方小学位于浦东经济开发区。学校里大约有 500 名学生和 50 名教师。直到 现在，我仍然记得它被一个小公园和一些公寓包围着。这所学校比附近的其他学校更注重英语学习。<br>
起初,当我进入学校,我有点胆小,但我的班主任注意到我,并帮助我融入班集体。他名叫迈克，教授英语。 他真的很好很有趣。他总是带我们去学校图书馆读和听一些原版的英语书。他总是那么热切地想回答我 们的问题。说实话，我们从他那里学到了很多词汇和语法。迈克曾经告诉我们:如果我们想学习一些东西， 我们应该对它有强烈的兴趣来激励自己学习。 此外，我的班级很友好且积极向上。这使我渴望和同学一起更努力地学习。我明白了在你的学习环境中保持积极的态度来获得学习的动力是非常重要的。现在，每当我想起我的好老师和勤奋的同学，我就会想念我的小学。</p>

<p>It’s been a really long time since I’ve met with my friends from primary school. So, we wanted to plan a reunion and have dinner together last Friday at a Pizza Hut near our old primary school.<br>
At 6:00 pm, classmates arrived, and we took up four tables of space and had pizza together. However, I gradually found that we actually did not have much in common to talk about with each other. For example, most girls liked to chat about how handsome or how rich their boyfriends were. Boys were interested in discussing the computer games and NBA , etc. To me, I had no boyfriend and no interest in any computer games or basketball. So, I was getting bored soon and wanted to go home as early as possible. But in order to be polite, I could only try to look interested while I was listening to their conversation. Actually, I was bored stiff and even yawned once at the dinner table.<br>
Frankly speaking, I really had a very boring time that night. I thought the main reason was that I haven’t seen my friends for years, and we hadn’t updated each other with our new events and ideas in daily life. As we got older and older, we had less and less time to meet with each other. Then there are less and less common topics for us to chat about. In general, I was very disappointed with this reunion although I was so eager to see my friends at the very beginning.<br>

我已经很久没有见到我小学时的朋友了。所以上周五我们想要重聚，一起在老小学附近的必胜客吃晚饭。<br>
下午 6 点，同学们来了，我们占了四张桌子，一起吃披萨。然而，我逐渐发现，我们实际上并没有太多 的共同之处来谈论彼此。例如，大多数女孩喜欢谈论她们的男朋友有多帅或多有钱。男孩子们对讨论电 子游戏和篮球很感兴趣。对我来说，我没有男朋友，对任何游戏和篮球都不感兴趣。所以我很快就厌倦 了，想早点回家。但是为了表示我的礼貌，我只能在听他们谈话的时候尽量表现出感兴趣的样子。事实 上，我无聊得僵硬，甚至有一次在吃饭的时候打了个哈欠。<br>
坦白地说，那天晚上我真的很无聊。我认为主要的原因是我已经很多年没有见到我的朋友了，我们也没 有在日常生活中互相更新我们的新事件和想法。随着年龄的增长，我们见面的时间越来越少。然后我们 可以聊天的话题就会越来越少。总的来说，虽然一开始我很想见我的朋友，但是这次聚会让我很失望。</p>

<p>After I got my driver license, driving myself on journeys brought me wonderful feelings about the scenery and things I experienced on the way. In order to enjoy the freedom and flexibility of driving myself on a tour, I decided to drive to Mawei Island with my family several months ago.<br>
It took us almost four hours to drive from Guangzhou to Mawei Island. Unfortunately, on the way it started to rain and we could not help but be concerned about the weather at the island. While we were driving along the road to the hill of the island, the rain stopped after a while and it became sunny again. Just then, I looked up and found the rainbow, a masterpiece of rain and the sun. It hung high in the sky like a colourful sky-bridge above the sea. From a distance, it was as thin as a ribbon. Seven colors shined brightly, bright but not dazzling. I stood on the top of the island and looked at the sea with blue sky and white cloud. The rainbow was like a band woven by flowers, which was hanging on the skirt of sky blue and floating with white clouds.<br>
The scene was delightful and beautiful! I could not stop taking a lot of pictures while watching the marvelous and fascinating sky. It solidified all the soft colors of the world in the sky. It seemed to bring us into a fairy tale world, brilliant and dazzling. We were fascinated by this beautiful sky and stayed until sunset. It was an unforgettable memory for my family in the recent years.<br>

Three months ago, I borrowed a wrist watch from my father. I was scheduled to take standardized tests for school and I wanted a watch so I would know the time.<br>
All of my friends and I check the time on our cell phones, but cell phones aren’t allowed in the examination rooms. Then I remembered that my father owned a nice watch, so I asked him. I wasn't sure he'd loan it to me because it's very expensive, but he didn't hesitate. On the day of the exam, he gave it to me and said, “I hope it brings you good luck! Take good care of it.” And I never took it off my wrist the whole day!<br>
These standardized tests are timed. I didn’t know if there would be a clock in the room that I could see from my seat. If I know the exactly time, I will be able to adjust my speed of answering the questions and set aside time to check my answers.<br>
The watch was very, very useful for me. Doing well on these tests is very important. I really appreciated that my father trusted me with his watch and I gave it back to him with my thanks. In fact, this watch gave me more confidence and courage from my father when I was taking the exams.<br>

<p>When I was still in high school, I was excelling in almost every single course that I took. However, I never really developed any liking to study because nothing really caught my interest.<br>
It was soon the year where I had to decide which major I should choose for my university study. My father wanted me to study chemistry because he was a specialist in this field and he could arrange a good job for me in the future. I agreed to do so, but I was not sure whether I was interested in it. My mom was definitely the first one who noticed that I wasn’t really happy learning chemistry. One day after school, she told me that I shouldn’t just follow what they suggested for me to do. I was a little shocked and asked why she told me that. My mom explained that it was because she wanted me to find what I actually had interest in to pursue my future career.<br>
With my mom’s advice, I spent a whole week trying out different school clubs, experiencing different activities, and exploring new interests. I started to gain interest in learning visual arts. This was because of a visual artwork in a show. And I was mesmerized by the different messages and feelings it conveyed.<br>
So, I chose visual arts as my major in university. My mom’s advice gave me more confidence to choose what I was fascinated with. I realized that: the most important thing when choosing a major is interest because interest is one of the biggest motivators for one to work hard in your studies.<br>

<p>When it comes to a kind of food that is popular in my region, there is one kind that sticks out in my mind, and that is litchi(荔枝). I am a foodie and a big fan of litchi. Litchi is one of the most popular fruits in my region and it has been well-known in China for hundreds of years.<br>
Litchi is the fruit of the litchi tree, a tropical fruit that can only be grown in the south because it only grows in areas with high temperatures and humidity. Guangdong and Fujian are its main producing areas. Litchi looks red and is as small as a Ping-Pong ball.<br>
Regarding to why it’s popular, well, I guess the main reason probably lies in the taste, which is quite subtle, but at the same time, very distinctive. Litchi tastes very sweet, not sour at all, and tastes like jelly. If you’ve ever had it before, you’ll notice that the flavour kind of lingers in your mouth, especially its sweet taste. Litchi can not only be eaten directly, but also be made into preserved fruit and canned food. My mother even told me that it is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine, which can help sleep and promote digestion<br>

Yesterday when my mom looked at one of these photos, she burst into loud laughter. This picture was taken by her at Christmas Eve when I was seven years old. In the picture, I was standing between my parents and smiling in front of a Christmas tree with a piece of mail in hand.<br>
I had believed in Santa Claus since I was little. I thought Santa was a human being who could come to our house and climbed into our home from the chimney. I was going to send a letter to Santa to request a nice present. The letter was the one held in my hand in that picture.<br>
As I grew up, I came to understand that it was my parents who had pretended to be Santa Claus to give me presents at Christmas Eve every year. This touching photo they took when I was seven is one of the best pictures I like. What a heart-warming and memorable story is behind this precious photo! While my mom told me the story of this picture, I can see her face was full of joy and happiness. This is the reason I like this picture the most.<br>

Every night at eight o 'clock, there is a laser light show in Victoria Harbor. All the lights along the harbour are turned on. The buildings on both sides of the harbour are completely outlined into different shapes and colors by the lighting system. Besides, many different kinds of fireworks will be lit off in the high sky with the rhythm of music. All of this make the light show to be one of the most fascinating night scenes in the world. My grandpa was very excited to see such a light show and asked me to take many photos for him. I also took some wonderful photos of the night scene, which I shared with my friends and they all thought it was very beautiful.<br>

<p>About two years ago, I made a wooden bird for my mother as a birthday gift. My mother loves wooden handicraft, so I decided to make a special gift by myself.<br>
In our school, I’ve learned how to design some small pieces of handicrafts. Our teacher taught us many skills on how to deal with soft woods as well as hard woods. Moreover, along with stone, clay, and animal parts, wood was one of the first materials worked by early humans. Thus, it was not so difficult for me to make a wooden bird. After learning, I got to know that softwood was most commonly found in China and is lighter in weight. The lower density of softwoods allows it to have a great strength, and it is also more available and accessible. Therefore, finally, I decided to make the wooden bird of softwoods, and I did it in about half a month. It took me a long time to shape this wooden bird as I was not that kind of ingenious person. But I thought the effort was worthwhile because this wooden bird has a pointed mouth and a high tail that is very lifelike.<br>
It is really a memorable experience, because it was the first time that I made something by myself. Moreover, I also found that wooden handicraft making, along with other leisurely activities, could strengthen our body as well as our brain. Furthermore, making something by hand and then giving it as a gift really helps in social interaction. After making that wooden bird for my mother, I often invite my friends over to make wooden handicrafts together with me, and this is really an effective way to make friends.<br>

<p>Whenever I think of Lucy, my best friend in high school, I feel terribly ashamed and regretful that I did not tell her the truth that I actually spent more time studying than she did every day.<br>
It is well-known that the College Entrance Exam is crucial for every student in the high schools. This caused some unnecessary competitions among classmates, including Lucy and I. We used to study and play together like twins at school. Both of us wanted to go to the same university and major in finance, which is a very popular major in today's China.<br>
I remember it was the Friday evening before the exam. Lucy wanted to go to the school library with me to study. But I told her that I have never studied on Friday evenings. In fact, I reviewed my textbooks every evening and studied harder than anyone else in my class. But I did not want to tell Lucy the truth when she invited me to the library with her. Eventually, I was admitted by our dream school, but Lucy, unfortunately, couldn’t make it happen.<br>
Nowadays, even though we are still best friends chatting online every day, I am always ashamed of myself that I lied to Lucy. Sometimes I ask myself whether I should tell her the truth when I meet her in person again. However, I don’t want to do so because I am afraid it will ruin our friendship forever. From this, I learn that we should have positive, not the negative competition between best friends. This will help both of us to maintain our friendship and grow together.<br>

每当我想起高中最好的朋友露西，我感到非常羞愧和遗憾，我没有告诉她的真相是我实际上每天比她花了更多的时间来学习。众所周知，高考对每一个高中生来说都是至关重要的。这导致了一些同学之间不必要的竞争，包括露西和我。我们曾经在学校像双胞胎一样一起学习和玩耍。我们都想去同一所大学学习金融专业，这在今天的中国是一个非常受欢迎的专业。我记得那是考试前的星期五晚上。露西想和我一起去学校图书馆学习。但是我告诉她我从来没有在星期五晚上学习过。事实上，我每天晚上都复习我的课本，比班上任何人都用功。但是当露西邀请我和她一起去图书馆时，我不想告诉她真相。最终，我被我们梦想中的学校录取了，但不幸的是，露西没能如愿<br>
以偿。如今，即使我们仍然是每天在网上聊天的好朋友，我总是为自己对露西说谎而感到羞愧。有时我问自己， 当我再次见到她时，是否应该告诉她真相。然而，我不想这样做，因为我担心这会永远毁掉我们的友谊。 从中，我学到我们之间应该是良心竞争关系，而不是最好的朋友之间的消极竞争。这将有助于我们双方 保持友谊，共同成长。</p>

<p>Honestly. I am a careless person and often lose stuff especially when I am in a rush. Last summer, I lost my cell phone, but fortunately I found it in the end.<br>
It was a Saturday morning, and my sister and I were going to Hong Kong to go shopping. As soon as we arrived at the train station, my sister paid for the taxi fare, and then we ran to the boarding gate. All of the sudden, I realized my cell phone was not in my pocket when I reached for it to check the train information.<br>
The first possibility came up to my mind was that I might have left it in the taxi just now. My sister called the taxi company right away. We were informed that the taxi driver did not leave, but was waiting for us to pick up our phone. I burst into tears because I was so panicked when I realized I lost my cell phone. I was afraid that I had lost a lot of my lovely family pictures in it.<br>
Nowadays, cell phones become our necessity in our daily life. We use them like pocket-size computers for most of our activities. Losing a cell phone is like a disaster, especially when we are on a trip. I wanted to reward the driver, but he refused to accept it. He said that it was what he should do. There is a saying: The kindness from strangers is sometimes more touching. I felt relaxed and warm in my heart at that moment. This impressed me because my feelings were just like a roller coaster, from when I lost and then found my cell phone.<br>

如今，手机成为我们日常生活中的必需品。我们在大多数时间里面都像使用袖珍电脑一样使用它们。失 去手机就像一场灾难，尤其是当我们在旅行的时候。我想报答司机，但他拒绝了。他说这是他应该做的。 俗话说:陌生人的善良有时更令人感动。那一刻，我感到内心的放松和温暖。这给我留下了深刻的印象， 因为我的感觉就像过山车一样，从我迷路的时候，然后找到我的手机。</p>

<p>Two years ago, I read in the community newspaper that a swimming pool complex would be built only five blocks from my home. Recently, it was completed and opened to the public. My friends and I were very curious about how it looks. We wanted to go for a visit.<br>
As expected, this swimming pool complex gives lessons in the main pool for adults and children. There are also competitive swim teams that practice in the pool. And, there is a diving pool that has three diving boards at different heights and people can take diving lessons there also.<br>
First of all, what I really like about the pool complex is that it has open hours when anyone can go in and use the facilities just for fun. My friends and I especially enjoy the diving area. I think having this great facility so close to my home is special and I consider myself very lucky. My friends and I swim and dive much more frequently because we don’t have to travel to the sea shore for swimming. It gives everyone a fun place to go, especially when we want to cool off in the summer.<br>
In addition, a lot of international swimming competitions are held in this pool complex and they are exciting for me and my neighborhood to watch. It’s become a meeting area for the whole neighborhood, young and old. It really builds a sense of community belonging for everyone who lives around it.

两年前，我在社区报纸上看到一个游泳场馆将建在离我家只有五个街区的地方。最近，它完工了并向公众开放。我和朋友们都很好奇它是什么样子。我们想去参观一下。不出所料，这个游泳场馆在主泳池为成人和儿童提供课程。还有一些竞争激烈的游泳队在游泳池里练习。 还有一个跳水池，有三个不同高度的跳板，人们可以在那里上跳水课。 首先，我真正喜欢游泳池的原因是它有开放时间，任何人都可以进去，只是为了好玩。我和我的朋友特别喜欢跳水区。我觉得有这样一个离我家这么近的设施很特别，我觉得自己很幸运。我和我的朋友们经常游泳和跳水，因为我们不必去海边游泳。它给每个人一个有趣的地方去，特别是当我们想在夏天凉快一些。此外，许多国际游泳比赛都在这个游泳池举行，我和我的邻居都非常兴奋可以观看比赛。它已经成为整个社区的聚会场所，无论老少。它确实为生活在它周围的每个人建立了一种社区归属感。它提高了我们社区居民的生活质量。</p>

I really enjoy family games at home with my parents and grandparents. Saturdays are usually our family days. We gather at our living room and play poker games after dinner.<br>
Poker is a competitive card game among several players. Most of the time, my grandparents would like to form a team; my father, my mother and I are the independent players. The table game we play the most is called Blackjack. The object of the game is to get the total value of your cards as close to 21 without going over. This is how the game is played out. Actually, we do not bet money among family members, the loser usually needs to wash dishes or do housework after dinner.<br>
Every Saturday evening, playing poker games together is an essential leisure activity in my family. My family has gathered for the family game since I was 16. It becomes a hobby for every family member. My grandparents had this idea because they wanted to maintain the cohesion of the family.<br>
To me, I enjoy playing with my parents because I like to share fun and happiness with each other during the game. We often chat and laugh together while we are playing. I think this harmonious environment is the necessary element I long for in a happy family. Playing indoor games with family on Saturday is very leisurely because we do not need to worry about weather, transportation, or food. I think it is a relaxed, healthy, warm and sweet way for the family to gather.<br>
中文思路:<br>
我非常喜欢和我的父母和祖父母在家里玩家庭游戏。星期六通常是我们的家庭日。晚饭后，我们聚在客 厅里玩扑克。扑克是一种多人参与的竞争性纸牌游戏。大多数时候，我的祖父母组成一个团队，我的父 亲，我的母亲和我是独立的成员。我们玩得最多的游戏叫 21 点。这款游戏的目标是让你的卡牌的总值接 近 21，而不需要翻牌或爆牌。这就是游戏的玩法。其实我们在家庭成员之间是不赌钱的，输的人通常晚 饭后要洗碗或做家务。<br>
每个星期六晚上，在家一起打扑克是一项必不可少的休闲活动。从我 16 岁起，我的家人就聚在一起玩家 庭游戏。它成为了每个家庭成员的爱好。我的祖父母想出这个点子因为他们想保持家庭的凝聚力。对我 来说，我喜欢和我的父母一起玩，因为我想在游戏中分享彼此的乐趣和幸福。玩游戏时我们经常一起聊 天和笑。我认为这种和谐的环境是我渴望幸福家庭的必要因素。星期六和家人在室内玩游戏是非常悠闲 的，因为我们不需要担心天气，交通和食物。对我来说，这是一个轻松、健康、温暖、温馨的家庭聚会 形式。</p>

<p>My father has been working in a German chemical company for 20 years. I know that he works very hard every day. And he has been promoted from a sales person to a sales manager and is now the general director of the company in Asia.<br>
When I was little, I had already noticed that my father always needed to travel for his job. He would take airplanes from South to North China, and from East to West Worldwide. He devoted himself to his job completely, especially when he was promoted to the general director in charge of the Asian market. He loves this new challenge as he keeps telling me all the time. Nowadays he travels much more than before. The cities he often flies to include: Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Soul, New Dehli, and Singapore etc.<br>
Compared with the high speed rail, airplane is a fastest mode of transportation for people to take between two cities that are far apart. Since my father is so busy with his job, I can see he walks faster than people around him. He never wastes his time on insipid things. He always sets goals, one after another, and works hard to achieve them.<br>
In general, my father enjoys doing his job for his company. He always tells me he works hard because he would like my mom to be relaxed at home taking care of me. In addition, when he travels to different cities and different countries, he likes to meet different people, see different cultures and purchase gifts for me and my mom. All of these are the motivation for my father to work hard every day.<br>

我父亲在一家德国化学公司工作了 20 年。我知道他每天都努力工作。他从一个销售人员晋升为销售经理， 现在是该公司亚洲地区的总经理。当我还小的时候，我就已经注意到我父亲总是出差。坐飞机从中国的 南边到北边，从东方到西方。特别是当他作为亚洲市场的总经理时，全身心地投入到工作中。他一直告 诉我喜欢这个新挑战。现在他比以前出差的更多。他经常飞往的城市包括:北京、上海、东京、首尔、新 德里和新加坡等。与高速铁路相比，飞机是人们在两个遥远城市之间最快的交通工具。由于我父亲工作 太忙，我可以看到他走得比周围的人都快。他从不把时间浪费在无聊的事情上。他总是一个接一个地设 定目标，并努力实现它们。总的来说，我父亲喜欢为他的公司工作。他总是告诉我他工作很努力，因为 他想让妈妈在家放松地照顾我。此外，当他去不同的城市和国家出差时，他喜欢认识不同的人，看到不 同的文化，给我和我的妈妈买礼物。所有这些都是我父亲每天努力工作的动力。</p>

<p>Recently, the happiest thing was that our school gave us a day off for the school anniversary celebration. That’s to say, I got a whole day that I didn’t have to study or work, I could relax a bit. My best friend Lucy called me and asked me if I wanted to try skiing. I said yes. So, we decided to go to the Four Seasons Ski Resort together.<br>
This is an indoor ski resort that is open all year round. I felt very fresh and excited, because I had never seen snow in summer days. We put on thick ski clothes which made us looked stupid and cumbersome. We looked at each other and couldn't help but laugh.<br>
When I really started skiing, I found I couldn't keep my balance and fell down many times. It was also the first time for Lucy to ski, but she was obviously better than I. While I was still learning how to keep my balance and move slowly, she was already sliding slowly down the slope. I was depressed because on the way to the ski resort, I thought skiing would be so easy to learn. But the truth was, I could hardly go for more than a few meters. At this time, Lucy came up to encourage me and explained the skiing skills. Then I did as she said and practiced for a while. Eventually, I could ski for a while and it filled me with joy.<br>
It was really fun to play with my good friends and utterly relax without any pressure. I hope to try a bigger outdoor ski resort in winter.<br>

近期最开心的事，莫过于学校校庆给我们放了一天的假。这意味着我拥有了完整的一天，不要工作或者 学习。可以好好的放松和享受自由。我最好的朋友 lucy 打电话给我，问我要不要去尝试一下滑雪。我表 示很感兴趣。我们决定一起去四季滑雪场玩。<br>
这是一个室内的滑雪场，一年四季都开放。我感到非常新鲜和兴奋，因为我从来没有在夏天见过雪。我 们换上了厚厚的滑雪服，夏天穿成这样实在是很滑稽，我们忍不住哈哈大笑起来。<br>
当我真正开始滑雪时，我发现我无法保持平衡，没走出几米就摔倒了。Lucy 虽然也是第一次滑雪，但显 然他比我有天分的多。当我还在学习如何缓慢前进保持平衡的时候，他已经可以从坡上慢慢的滑下来了。 他看到我很沮丧，过来鼓励我，并且告诉我一些滑雪技巧。我练习了一阵，果然可以慢慢滑动了，我开 心极了。我们一直玩到晚上才回家。和我的好朋友一起，没有压力完全放松的玩耍，真的感觉很快乐， 我希望在冬天的时候能去更大的室外滑雪场试试。</p>

They will invite the hottest singers or actors to the stage. The show lasts for two to three hours and they will perform songs and dances or play games with the host.<br>
This summer vacation, my good friend Lucy and I travelled to Hunan. We found the discount ticket of the Happy Camp in Taobao.com by chance and we immediately bought two tickets! The show is recorded in the broadcasting building of Hunan Television Station. To our surprise, there was a sea of people outside the building. Lucy and I almost got lost! There were so many people that we only had one bar on our cell phones. Finally, we managed to get into the stadium and sit down.<br>
As soon as the host, HeJiong, stepped on the stage, the entire audience got excited! We shouted his name so loud that we could hardly hear each other. The famous actors Denglun and Lixian were guests. They played many different kinds of games with hosts and Lixian even performed dubbing!<br>
My generation all grew up watching this variety show, so I was very happy to come to its live performance. It was an unforgettable experience. Lucy and I had made up our minds to go to this performance again in the future.<br>

快乐大本营这个节目陪伴了我们这一代人一起长大，尽管这里拥挤又嘈杂，看节目花了将近五个小时，但 我还是非常开心能来到现场。能够见到偶像本人，是一件非常幸福的事!我和 lucy 约好下个假期还要一起 来看节目。</p>

The program is recorded in the broadcasting building of Hunan Television Station. When we went into the recording venue, we were told that due to the need for program confidentiality, we were not allowed to bring mobile phones, cameras, or other photographic equipment to watch the program. Even snacks and drinks were not allowed. So, we had to put our personal belongs in a locker.<br>
We waited for almost an hour for the recording to start. During this period, we were very bored because we had nothing to do. As soon as the host, HeJiong, stepped on the stage, the entire audience got excited! The famous actors Denglun and Lixian were guests. They played many different kinds of games with hosts and Lixian even performed dubbing!<br>
I was very excited to participate in this program and saw the idol himself!I really want to take a picture or video, but we were not allowed to bring our mobile phone. For me, my mobile phone is not only a tool to contact others, but also a part of my life. I usually take photos anytime and anywhere. I think it is a bit strict to restrict the audience from carrying their mobile phones and I wish they would change this rule in the future.<br>

<p>It's annoying to have your plans changed, but sometimes you have to change them. This summer vacation, my family and I planned to travel to Bangkok. This was the first time for my whole family to travel together this year. I had prepared for it for a long time, and I was full of expectations.<br>
We wanted to go to the airport by metro since it was the most convenient and fastest way to get to the airport. But when got to the metro station, I got a SMS which informed us that our flight had been cancelled for some unknown reason. We were confused because it was only three hours before the plane was scheduled take off. My mom said it was possibly fake information. But to be prepared for any contingency, I made a call to the flight company. Surprisingly, they told me they were very sorry that our flight was cancelled indeed and they would offer us some alternative flight to change to later, but it wouldn’t be today. Though we were very angry about that, we had no choice but to go back home and wait for further information.<br>
On the way home, my mom kept saying that this message was so important that if we didn't see it, we would probably have waited for hours at the airport and then come back for nothing. Now it only took ten minutes to walk to the subway station. But it was still an unpleasant thing to be delayed on our journey.<br>

计划被改变是一件很懊恼的事情，但有时候不得不改变计划。今年暑假我们全家计划去泰国曼谷旅行，这 是全家人今年第一次一起旅行，为此我准备了很长时间，内心充满了期待。<br>
我们打算乘地铁去机场，这是最快最便捷的方式。就在刚出发的时候，我的手机响了。我收到了一条短信， 短信显示我们的航班由于无法得知的外部因素被取消了。我感到很诧异，毕竟现在距离起飞只有三个小时。 我开始怀疑这是骗子，于是致电航空公司询问情况，结果是我们的航班确实被取消了。我感到非常生气， 我们一家人只能折返回家。<br>
回家路上妈妈一直说这条信息实在太重要了，如果没有看到信息，我们很可能在机场无聊的等待好几个小 时，最后再无功而返。而现在只是花了十分钟走到地铁站而已。但旅程被延误还是一件令人不愉快的事情。</p>

<p>This year, as a member of the student union of our college, I organized a singing competition at our college with several classmates from our student union department. It was the first time I've been involved in planning an event. At first, I was very nervous and didn't know what I could do in the team. But the minister of our department, Michael, had experience in organizing competitions, and he told us in detail how to organize it. Under his leadership, we divided the labor fairly. I was responsible for the designs of posters and application forms.<br>
At first, I didn't think it would be difficult. But the minister was not satisfied with my design and told me I had to use Photoshop to design a poster. This meant that I had to master how to use this software in a short time. It was such a huge challenge and I felt very anxious. I downloaded a lot of instructional videos and even stayed up late studying it. Our minister also taught me some skills and shortcuts on how to use Photoshop, which were very helpful. With his help, I mastered some basic operations and made some good posters.<br>
I learned a lot during this experience. It is very useful to master more practical skills. Also, when encountering difficulties, we should calm down and try our best to find the solutions.<br>

<p>The family member I spent most time with is definitely my sister. She is 5 years older than I and I have known her since I was born. I think she is the one who could understand and know my thoughts most in my family because my parents and I can never get along peacefully due to the age barrier.<br>
When we were young, we played together, cursed each other, but cared about each other too. Whenever there were students who bullied me, she would always stand by me. We share happiness, overcome difficulties together and cherish the affection between us.<br>
As we grew up, dad and mom were usually busy working. It was my sister who cared me more than my parents. She not only helped me with my homework, but also helped me cultivate many good habits. She likes to read different kinds of books from novels to literature. So, I began to read books in a very early age. She taught me that reading can open our minds and broaden our horizons. So, I am always very good at Chinese lessons. She never brings out the facts and reasons to teach me, but influences me with her words and deeds. She has taught me many things that have benefited me all of my life. I love and thank her very much.<br>

平时在家里，陪伴我最多的人就是我的姐姐，她比我大五岁，我从一出生起就认识她了。很多时候，由于 年龄的差距，我觉得和父母无法沟通，只有姐姐才能真正的理解我。小的时候我们一起打打闹闹，嘴上咒 骂着对方，心里却关心惦记着彼此。只要有同学欺负我，我回家找姐姐诉苦，他总是气的要找别人算账。 在我们的成长中，有彼此的陪伴，慰藉，从来不会感到孤单。<br>
后来我们逐渐长大，父母的工作也越来越忙碌。比起妈妈，都是姐姐照顾我更多。姐姐不仅在生活上照顾 我，辅导我的作业。更是言传身教，让我养成了很多好习惯。姐姐非常喜欢读书，她有空的时候从不看无 聊的电视剧，会阅读各种类型的书籍。所以我从小就跟着姐姐一起看书，从小时候的故事书看到现在的文 学历史。姐姐在不知不觉中教会我读书可以使人开阔视野。从小到大，我的语文成绩一直在班里名列前茅。 她从不给我讲道理，而是用自己的一言一行影响着我。他教给我的很多东西都让我受益一生，我非常爱她 和感谢她。</p>

<p>About a couple of weeks ago, I broke my cell phone accidentally. But my mum promised to buy me a new one since I had used the broken cell phone for about two years and I got good scores on the final exams. I eventually bought a Huawei mate 30. As soon as I got it, I was fascinated by its beautiful appearance. The aurora-colored shell glowed with enchantment. Moreover, it has a very good photo shooting function since it had a Leica camera. I was very excited at first. But when I got home, I began to study the instructions. I found that Huawei's operating system was completely different from iPhone, and almost all the operations had to be re-adapted. I spent the whole night studying the instructions and searching online, and then understood its basic operations.<br>
Then I tried to import the data from the original iPhone into the new phone. At this time, I found it very difficult. Except for the address book and a few apps, the original photos, notepad and most of the apps had to be downloaded again. This series of problems made me feel that this mobile phone was too difficult to use. It took me almost two weeks to get used to it. I thought if I had the chance, I absolutely would have bought the latest iPhone instead.<br>
中文思路: 大概几周前，我原来的手机摔碎了，因为它已经使用了两年时间，加上这次期末考试我的成绩还不错，妈 妈答应给我买一部新手机。我想来想去，最后买了一部华为 mate30 手机。 刚拿到手，我就被它美丽的外观迷倒了。极光色的外壳闪着迷人的光芒。加上莱卡的摄像头，特别是拍照 功能实在是太强大了。一开始我高兴极了。回家后我开始翻看说明书，发现华为的操作系统和苹果完全不一样，几乎所有的操作都要重新适应，我用 了一整晚时间，不停的翻看说明书和上网查找方法，才明白了它的基本使用。 接着我尝试把原先 iphone 里的资料导入新手机，这时候我发现非常困难，除了通讯录和个别 app 可以传入 新手机，原先的照片，记事本和大部分的 app 都要重新下载。这一系列的问题让我觉得这部手机实在是太 难用了。我几乎用了两周时间在逐渐适应它的操作。如果再给我一次机会，我会买一部最新款的 iPhone.</p>

You should say:<br>
What you were helping the person with<br>
Who did you help<br>
When it happened<br>
And explain how you felt after helping the person</p>
<p>In our daily life, we may help others or be helped by others. We will lead a happier and more harmonious life because of others’ help. During my summer vacation this year, I had a part-time job at a café and recognized a new friend, Lucy.<br>
She comes from England and she is a nice girl. She came here to study for a master degree, but she was not good in Chinese. So, whenever we got off from work or whenever I was free, I would teach her some useful methods to learn Chinese. I also introduced her to other Chinese friends and took her to our school’s activities. I could notice that she improved her Chinese skills day by day and I was very glad about that. Lucy has been learning Chinese for half a year, and she can communicate with others in Chinese fluently. Last time we went to KTV, she could even sing a Chinese song. During this period, I learned how to get along with others. I felt that I had done the right thing. It is good to help others and it is also important to be a kind person. I helped her for no other reason than I thought it was the right thing to do.<br>
中文思路: 在我们的生活中，我们被帮助或得到别人的帮助，因为帮助，我们可以生活得更快乐。暑假的时候我在咖 啡馆做兼职，认识了好朋友 lucy。 她是一位英国的留学生，刚刚来到中国。她的汉语不好，但我很擅长。所以每当我们下班，或者我有空的 时候，我就会教她一些有用的学习方法来学习汉语。我还介绍了别的中国朋友给她认识，带她去参加我们 的聚会。我能感觉到她的中文能力逐渐在提高，对此感到很欣慰。直到现在，lucy 学习汉语半年时间了， 她已经可以正常交流，上次我们一起去 ktv，她甚至唱了一首中文歌。 在这个过程中，我学会了如何与他人相处融洽。在我看来，帮助别人不仅是快乐的自己，也让我们学会分 享。在这个过程中，我还认识了更多朋友，扩大了自己的交际圈。我认为这是一个快乐的过程。</p>

<p>Describe a uniform you wore when you were a student or at work<br>
You should say:<br>
When and where you had to wear this<br>
How it looks like<br>
Why you had to wear this<br>
And explain how you feel about wearing it</p>
<p>When I was in college, I rarely wore a uniform. I only wore it for important school events. So, I want to talk about school uniforms which I wore before.<br>
My high school gave us two types of school uniforms, one was for the winter, the other was for the summer. The summer school uniform was a light green T-shirt with shorts, while the winter school uniform was dark green trousers with a black cotton coat. At that time, we were required to wear uniforms at school. That meant I had to wear it every day.<br>
I think the reason why the school required us wear the uniform is that the school uniform is a kind of a status symbol, just like people of different professions need to wear different uniforms in society. For example, policemen, firemen, doctors and soldiers all have their own special clothes. Similarly, students naturally wear their school uniforms. When we put on our school uniforms, it is easier to recognize that we are students.<br>
As for me, I like wearing school uniforms very much. Uniforms can create a sense of equality. Because the family financial background varies from person to person, many people are outdoing each other to see who has a bigger house and who has a better car. If we wear the same clothes, not only students feel equal to each other, but also it is easier to create a spirit of cooperation, unity, and mutual respect.<br>
中文思路:<br>
上大学之后我很少穿校服，只有在学校重要活动的时候才会穿。所以我想谈谈之前的校服。 我高中的校服分为冬季和夏季。夏季的校服是浅绿色的 T 恤和短裤，而冬天的校服是深绿色长裤和一件黑 色的棉大衣。那时候学校要求我们在学校必须穿着校服。也就是除了周末不上课的时间，我每天都得穿着 它。 我想学校让我们穿校服，主要是一种身份的象征。就像社会上不同职业的人需要穿着不同的制服一样。例 如警察，消防员，医生，军人都有自己特定的衣服。同样的，学生自然要穿他们的校服。我们穿上校服时， 就更容易辨认出我们是学生了。<br>
对于我而言，我很喜欢穿校服。校服可以产生一种平等感。因为现在学生的家庭收入状况很不一样，学生 之间攀比严重，比拼双方家底。而大家穿着一样的服装，不仅同学相互之间感觉还平等的，而且更容易行 程一种合作团结，相互尊重的精神。</p>

What you did in the end<br>
And explain how you feel about it</p>
<p>Last month, my friend and I were planning a party in the park. She and I were both going to invite ten friends and we were going to have a barbecue. The ten friends soon turned into twenty, but we didn't care, we thought we'd have a plenty of open space and it would be just fine. We were going to have a barbecue, play music and play volleyball because there was a volleyball court in the park. Unfortunately, the night before the party, we were listening to the weather report and it said we were going to have thunderstorms during the afternoon of the party. Obviously, we didn't want to have the party during thunderstorms. I suggested we cancel it and reschedule it at a later date. My friend disagreed because she had friends that were leaving town and if we changed the date, then they would not be able to come. So we thought about it and we decided to have the party at my house rather than the park.<br>
I'll be honest, it was a little crowded and we didn't have barbecue; we had sandwiches and hors d'oeuvres that we made, but everybody seemed to have a good time. We played music and we played some board games instead of volleyball. Although it different from the party we had originally planned, I think it was a good party and I felt happy that everyone enjoyed it.<br>
中文思路:<br>
上个月，我和我的朋友计划在公园里举行一个聚会。她和我都打算邀请 10 个朋友，我们打算去烧烤。10 个朋友很快就变成了 20 个，但我们不在乎，我们想我们有足够的空地，一切都会好起来的。我们打算去 烧烤，演奏音乐和打排球，因为公园里有一个排球场。不幸的是，聚会的前一天晚上，我们正在听天气预 报，天气预报说下午有雷雨。很明显，我们不想在雷暴的时候开派对。我建议我们取消它，改天再定。我 的朋友不同意，因为她有朋友要离开这个城市，如果我们改变日期，他们就不能来了。所以我们考虑了一 下，决定在我家举行聚会，而不是在公园。<br>
说实话，那里有点拥挤，我们也没有烧烤;我们做了三明治和开胃小菜，但每个人似乎都玩得很开心。我 们玩音乐，玩一些棋盘游戏而不是排球。虽然它不同于我们最初计划的聚会，我认为这是一个很好的聚会， 我很高兴大家都喜欢它。</p>

<p>My aunt and uncle own a car dealership and they seem to be the richest people in our family. Their company is located downtown, which is surrounded by a lot of auto shops. But I really don't like this kind of sales job. I know about the business because whenever we go to visit them, going to the car dealership is always a place that we have to stay. They sell new cars, but they also sell used cars. Some people will bring in their existing car and trade it in for a new car. They are always very busy and very involved in the business. If we want to visit with them, we often need to wait for them while they are finishing up some business, so they can do some sightseeing with us.<br>
I was always told by my father that I was not to do the same work as my uncle in the future because his working hours were not fixed, and he was always late for every family party. To a salesman, the customer is everything. As long as they call you, you need to fulfill their needs no matter how important the things are that you are doing, which is unacceptable to me.<br>
I think the reason why they are so successful and rich is that they are lucky and work harder than others. They often need to travel around the country or to go with clients to attend various dinners. In my opinion, they are already very good, but my uncle and aunt are not satisfied with that. They also attend business training courses to learn more knowledge and perhaps open another branch when the time is right. So only diligent and energetic people are suitable for similar jobs, but I am afraid I am not.<br>

我的阿姨和叔叔有一家汽车经销店，他们两个是我们家族最富有的人，他们的公司位于市区的汽车城，那 周围有很多汽车相关的店铺。但我非常不喜欢类似的工作，比如销售。我了解这个行业，因为每次我们去 拜访他们，汽车经销店总是一个我们必须呆的地方。他们卖新车，但也卖二手车。他们也有一个服务部门， 用来修理他们销售的汽车。他们总是很忙，非常投入的工作，如果我们想要去拜访他，有时我们需要等他 们完成一些业务，以便他们可以和我们一起观光。<br>
每次和他们吃完饭，我总会告诉爸爸将来一定不要做和叔叔同样工作，因为他的工作时间不固定，每次聚 会他总会迟到。对于一个销售来说，客户就是上帝。只要有客户有需求，不论有多重要的事都必须延后。 这对我来说是不能接受的。<br>
我认为他们之所以会很成功和很富有，除了运气好，还比别人付出了更多的时间。他们经常需要到全国各 地出差，又或者为了争取客户参加各种饭局。在我看来他们已经很厉害了，但是叔叔婶婶并不满足，他们 还参加了商业培训课程，想要学习更多知识，在时机成熟的时候再开一家分店。所以只有勤奋且精力充沛 的人才适合做类似的工作。</p>

<p>Recently, my friend Kathy and I decided to take a trip into Boston to see an old friend. Boston is about one and a half hours away by car. But we decided since neither of us knew the city well enough to drive in, or more importantly to park in because parking is a really big problem in Boston, we decided to take public transportation instead. We took the bus about halfway and then we had to transfer to a train that took us to the center of the shopping district.<br>
Travel time was scheduled to be about 3 hours. I was anxious about if we’d make the connection to the train in time, but there were no problems. The train was there when we arrived, so we didn't even have to wait. The bus and train were both very clean, comfortable, and fortunately, not very crowded. Time passed really, really quickly. Kathy and I were laughing and joking most of the way. The girl sitting next to me was kind and shared many snacks with us. The strangers we met on the train were kind and polite, and the atmosphere on the trip was great.<br>
When we arrived, we found that our old friend Olivia was in the station waiting for us. After a nice lunch that we ate outside and five hours of running from store to store, I was very glad that we chose to take public transportation home rather than to drive. Public transportation is economical and environmentally friendly, and we spent much less than driving. What’s more, we were both very, very tired and it was nice to be able to close our eyes and rest knowing that the train or the bus was taking us where we needed to go.<br>
中文思路:(可以把波士顿改为自己家乡周边的城市)<br>
最近，我和我的朋友凯茜决定去波士顿见一个老朋友。波士顿是大约两个半小时的车程，因为我们都不知 道开车去波士顿是否方便，因为停车在波士顿是一个大问题，我们决定乘坐公共交通工具。我们先乘大巴， 然后我们再转火车。<br>
行程时间约为 4 小时。我担心我们是否能及时赶上火车，但事实上没问题。我们到的时候火车已经停在站 里，我们不必等车。大巴和火车都非常干净，舒适。一路上凯茜和我都在闲聊和开玩笑，坐在隔壁的女孩 还分享了很多零食给我。车上遇到的陌生人都善良又礼貌，这趟旅途的气氛真是好极了。<br>
当我们到达了车站的时候，Olivia 已经在站里面等我们了。吃了一顿午饭后，我们三个在街上逛了五个小 时商店，并且买了很多东西，我很高兴，我们选择乘坐公共交通工具而不是开车回家。公共交通经济又环 保，这趟旅行的路费大约是我们自己开车的五分之一，而且因为我们知道火车或公共汽车把我们带回家， 所以疲惫的我们都闭上眼睛休息了。</p>

<p>An animal that I find interesting is a squirrel. When I traveled to the United States a few years ago, I saw many different kinds of squirrels which I had never seen in China. We could see them everywhere in America. They come in many different varieties and different colors.<br>
There was a big garden behind our hotel. They were always in the garden playing and they would be running around and looking for nuts. It was something that was very common for me to see, but I enjoyed watching them. I think they are fast, dexterous with their hands, intelligent and mischievous little animals. They live in trees and, especially in the fall, they look for acorns. They'll bury them and they'll be digging them up in the spring for food. The squirrels were in the trees, sometimes they would take these acorns in their hands and would throw them at us. They clearly didn't want us anywhere near their tree, even though it was our tree in our driveway, but they were funny. It was interesting to see them do this with their hands. I always thought that only humans and chimpanzees could use tools, but here we saw squirrels that were using their acorns as weapons. I just find them funny. I just think they are a very happy animal to watch.<br>
This experience was very unforgettable for me. The ecological environment in America is very good, so lovely wild animals can be seen everywhere. I think we should protect our environment so that I can see more lovely animals.<br>

我发现一种有趣的动物是松鼠。几年前我去美国旅游的时候，我见到了很多不同种类的松鼠，在中国我从 来没有见过，它们都可爱极了。在北美，松鼠随处可见。它们有许多不同的品种。它们有不同的颜色。<br>
我们的酒店有一个大大的庭院，他们总是在我们的院子里玩耍，他们会跑来跑去，寻找坚果，这对我来说 很罕见，所以我很喜欢看他们。我认为他们是快速，灵巧的手，聪明和淘气的小动物。它们生活在树上， 秋天的时候会寻找橡子，然后埋起来，春天的时候再挖出来找吃的。松鼠在树上，它们会用橡子当武器。 他们会把它们拿在手里扔向我。他们显然不希望我们靠近他们的树，即使那是我们车道上的树，但他们很 有趣。看到他们用手做这个真的很有趣。我一直认为只有人类和黑猩猩才会使用工具，但这里我们看到松 鼠用橡子当武器。我只是觉得它们很有趣。我只是发现它们只是一种非常快乐的动物。这次经历让我非常 难忘，美国的生态环境非常好，所以随处可见可爱的野生动物，我想我必须要更加爱护生态环境，这样才 能见到更多可爱的小动物。</p>

And explain why you want to live there</p>
<p>My ideal house would be near the ocean. I would want it to be small, like a cottage, because I wouldn’t want to use a lot of effort to keep a large house clean. The house would have big windows to let in the sunshine and the ocean could be seen from every room. I want a large living room so the family would be comfortable sitting together. Most importantly, it would have a large porch or deck so everyone could enjoy being outside.<br>
I want to live with my family, including my parents, grandparents and our dog. This house would have to be a second home because I will probably need to live in the city to be near my workplace. So, I would probably only be able to go to my ideal ocean home on weekends and on vacations.<br>
An ocean home would be ideal for me because I have always loved being at the beach. I always feel refreshed and relaxed after a walk near the water. I love all of the sights, sounds, and smells near the open ocean. Then, when I have a family of my own, my children would grow up learning about the marine life and appreciating the environment. I could have my parents and friends to the house and we could sit on the deck and enjoy the sunrise every morning as we sip our morning tea. Hopefully, everyone would enjoy being near the ocean and would visit often!<br>
中文思路:<br>
我理想的房子应该在海边。我想要小一点的，像一间小屋，因为我不想花太多的精力来保持一个大房子的 清洁。房子有个大窗户让阳光照进来，每个房间都能看到大海。我想要一个大客厅，这样全家人坐在一起 会很舒服。最重要的是，它将有一个大门廊或露台，这样每个人都可以享受户外生活。<br>
我想和我的家人住在一起，包括我的父母，祖父母以及我们家的狗狗。这栋房子必须是我的第二个家，因 为我可能需要住在城市里，才能离工作地点近一些。所以，我可能只能在周末和假期去我理想中的海洋之 家。<br>
靠近海的家对我来说是最理想的，因为我一直喜欢呆在海滩上。在海边散步之后，我总是感到神清气爽， 精神放松。我喜欢大海附近的所有景色、声音和气味。然后，当我有了自己的家庭，我的孩子长大后，会 学习海洋生物和欣赏环境。我可以让我的父母和朋友来家里，我们可以坐在甲板上享受日出，每天早上我 们喝早茶。希望每个人都喜欢在海边，并且经常来游玩!</p>

<p>There is a new swimming pool complex that was built five blocks from my home. It was completed about one month ago, and I feel it has improved the quality of life for everyone who lives around it.<br>
This area used to be a street market, which was not only messy but also dirty. There was a row of garbage cans in backdoor of the market, which smelled terrible on hot days. But after years of planning and construction, it has become a modern swimming pool. Every summer, my father and I used to drive 30 minutes to another stadium to swim and play badminton. But now, it only takes me 10 minutes walk to go to the new stadium which is very convenient for me.<br>
As you would expect, this swimming pool complex gives lessons in the main pool for adults and children. There are also competitive swim teams that practice in the pool. And there is a diving pool that has three diving boards at different heights and people can take diving lessons there also.<br>
In addition, this is the newest and largest swimming pool in our city and there will be an important race here next month. That will be exciting for me and my neighborhood to watch. It’s become a meeting area for the whole neighborhood, young and old. It really builds a sense of community belonging for everyone who lives around it. Our community is getting more and more convenient and prosperous, which I am very proud of.<br>

离我家五个街区远的地方，不久前建设了一座新的游泳馆。它大约在一个月前前完工，我觉得它改善了周 围居民的生活质量。<br>
这片区域以前是一个菜市场，里面不仅乱还很脏，市场后门还有一排垃圾桶，天气热的时候难闻极了。而 经过规划和几年的建设，这里已经变成了一所现代化的游泳馆。以前每到夏天，我和爸爸都需要开车 30 分钟到市体育馆去游泳，而现在我只需要步行十分钟就能到达。我感到方便极了。<br>
正如你所预料的，这个游泳馆的主游泳池为成人和儿童提供课程。还有一些有竞争力的游泳队在游泳池里 练习。它还有一个跳水池，它有三个不同高度的跳板，人们可以在那里学习跳水课程。<br>
此外，因为这里是目前我们城市最新最大的游泳馆，下个月将有一场重要比赛在这里举行。这对我和我的 邻居来说都是非常激动人心的。它已经成为整个社区的聚会场所，无论老少。它确实为周围的每个人建立 了一种社区归属感。我的社区正在越来越方便，越来越繁华，对此我非常的骄傲。</p>

<p>One time someone apologized to me was last November. Every November 11th, there is a huge festival called &quot;Double eleven&quot; when all online businesses, such as Tmall and JD, will have large-scale discount activities. I bought a lot of things that day, including a red dress. This is a dress that I am planning to wear when I go to Thailand for my winter vacation. I think it is beautiful to take photos in, so I was very excited to get it. But everything else arrived in a week except for my dress.<br>
I made a call to the delivery company to ask where my package had gone. They said they would deal with it and call me back later. Soon after, I received a call from the courier. He was very embarrassed to tell me that my delivery had been lost during the delivery process. He tried to find it, but failed. He felt very sorry and was willing to pay me for cost of the dress.<br>
The reason he apologized to me was that he thought he made a mistake which caused a loss to others. He had to pay me for another dress or he would have been fined by his company. To be honest, even after he apologized, I was still a little angry because I had to reorder the dress and wait a long time. But after that, I got over it because I think everyone has done something wrong. A little more tolerance towards others may be also promote a spirit of kindness and virtue.<br>
中文思路:<br>
一次别人向我道歉的经历发生在去年十一月份的时候。在每年十一月中国有都一个类似黑五的节日叫做双 十一，那一天所有的网络商家比如天猫，京东都会有大规模的打折活动。<br>
那天我买了很多东西，其中包括一条红色的连衣裙。这是我准备寒假去泰国旅游穿的，我觉得穿着它拍照 一定非常好看。我很焦急的等待快递的到来，可是一周过去了，其他东西都收到了，只有我的裙子还杳无 音讯。我向卖家打听裙子的下落，结果不久后，我接到了快递小哥打来的电话，他很不好意思的告诉我， 我的快递在派件过程中不小心弄丢了，他已经找了两天了，但并没有找到。他感到非常抱歉，希望我能谅 解。他愿意把那条裙子的钱赔偿给我。<br>
他向我道歉的原因是他在工作中的失误给别人造成了损失。他不仅要赔偿我一条裙子，而且还会被公司罚 款。老实讲，即使他道歉后我还是有点生气，因为我还需要重新下单，并且再等待很长一段时间。但是之 后，我就不计较了，我觉得每个人都有做错事的时候，对别人多一点宽容，也是一种善良和美德。</p>

I know about this competition because our teachers tell us about it in school - it's actually quite a famous competition among students in the city. As soon as I heard the news, I set a goal to join it and win the prize because the first three competitors would be rewarded a seven-day trip to Beijing!<br>
The competition’s format is quite straightforward; around a month before the competition begins, the organisers will release three potential topics for the students to use within the competition. All I would need to do is to choose one of the three topics and prepare my own speech. I tried my best to prepare for it. I looked up all kinds of materials, wrote the speech, and then asked my English teacher to help me revise. Then I practiced my speech in front of the mirror, from the pronunciation and intonation to the movements and expressions. I wanted to do my best.<br>
Finally, all of my effort paid off. I took the third place in the competition! Although I did not place first, I still am very happy because I earned a free trip to Beijing!<br>

比赛的形式很简单;每年演讲的主题都会有所变化，在比赛开始前两个月左右，组织者会发布三个可能的主 题供学生在比赛中使用。我所需要做的就是从这三个主题中选择一个，准备我自己的演讲。我开始认真准 备这场比赛。查询各种资料，写演讲稿，然后找我的英语老师帮我进行修改。之后对着镜子练习演讲，从 语音语调，到动作表情，我都希望做到最好。<br>
最后，我所有的努力都得到了回报。我拿到了第三名!虽然我没能拿到第一，但是我还是非常开心!因为 我还是获得了免费的北京七日游!</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about a man who has been in the news recently. He has just given awards to all rural teachers in China, and I'd love to meet him. He is Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.<br>
He is so famous in China that I believe every Chinese person must know about him. The reason why I want to meet him is that not only is he a successful enterpriser but also, he has greatly changed our country. He established a public service organization called “Ants Forest” which has planted thousands of trees in the deserts of China. He also established a charity fund called “Country teachers” which has donated millions to build schools and dormitories in remote and undeveloped areas.<br>
I don’t care when and where I could meet him. This is not the point. If I do get to see him, I want to ask him the reason why he donates so much of his property for charity. And, what has happened to him to make up his mind to do this? As we know, many entrepreneurs only want to make money and some of them even do harmful things to society in order to make more money, such as the development of online games, and not to donate money to charity.<br>
If I have the chance to meet him, I think it would have a big impact on my life. In short, I think I could learn a lot from him. In the process, I could also emulate him to some extent and become a person who changes the world.<br>
中文思路:<br>
我想要谈谈最近出现在新闻里的一个人，最近他刚刚为中国所有的乡村教师颁了奖，我很想见到他。他就 是阿里巴巴的创始人马云。<br>
他在中国很有名，我相信每个中国人都应该知道他。我想见他的原因是他不仅是一位成功的企业家，而且 他也使我们的国家发生了巨大的变化。他建立了一个公益组织。这项名为“蚁林”的服务在中国的沙漠中 种植了成千上万棵树。他还建立了一个名为“乡村教师”的慈善基金，为偏远落后地区修建学校或宿舍捐 赠了数百万美元。<br>
我不在乎何时何地能见到他。这不是重点。如果我能见到他，我想问问他为什么要把很多财产捐给慈善机 构，或者他是怎么决定做这件事的。我们知道，许多企业家只想赚钱，他们中的一些人甚至做一些对社会 有害的事情来赚更多的钱，比如开发网络游戏，而不是把钱捐给慈善机构。<br>
如果我真的能见到他的话，我想对我的生活会有很大的影响。简单的说，我认为我能从他身上学到很多东 西。在这个过程中，我也能从某种程度上效仿他，成为一个改变世界的人。</p>
<p>健康文章<br>
Describe an article you read from the internet about healthy lifestyles<br>
You should say:<br>
When and where was it posted<br>
What the article was about<br>
How useful the information was<br>
And explain how you feel about the article</p>
<p>Last week, I read an article from the website medicinetoday.net that was posted last year. The article was called “Healthy Tips for Healthy Living”. It was basically a long list of small changes that people could make in their lifestyle and eating habits that would help them be healthier. It included sections on both physical and mental health.<br>
Since the article was written fairly recently, I thought it would have some new ideas that were supported by scientific research. The article started by saying that physical health and mental health needed to function together for a healthy lifestyle. Since this is something I totally agree with, I quickly became excited to read it. However, once I started, I began to lose interest. It included many short tips for people to consider, like to stop smoking, avoid fried foods, exercise more frequently, and develop good sleep habits. The article did reference scientific research that supported these suggestions, but I felt much of the information was common knowledge that everyone would already know. Some more examples of this are to stop smoking, and not to drink alcohol and drive.<br>
However overall, I think it was a good article to read and I am pleased that I read it. It did review some of the things that I know are important for a healthy lifestyle, for instance, to avoid sugary foods, walk more, and avoid excessive sun exposure, all of which I need to be aware of! I am happy to review things that will help me live a healthier lifestyle!<br>
中文思路:<br>
上周，我读了一篇去年发表在 medicinetoday.net 网站上的文章。这篇文章被称为“健康生活小贴士”。它基 本上是一长串的小改变，人们可以改变他们的生活方式和饮食习惯，以帮助他们更健康。它包括生理和心 理健康的部分。<br>
由于这篇文章是最近写的，我认为它会有一些新的想法，并得到科学研究的支持。这篇文章一开始就说， 身体健康和心理健康需要共同作用，才能形成健康的生活方式。因为这是我完全同意的观点，我很快就被 吸引了。然而，一旦我继续读下去，我开始失去兴趣。文章包括了许多可供人们考虑的小建议，比如戒烟、 避免油炸食品、更频繁地锻炼、养成良好的睡眠习惯。这篇文章确实引用了支持这些建议的科学研究，但 我觉得很多信息都是大家都知道的常识。更多的例子是戒烟，不喝酒和开车。<br>
然而，总的来说，我认为这是一篇值得一读的好文章，我很高兴我读了它。它确实回顾了一些我知道对健 康生活方式很重要的事情，例如，避免含糖食物，多走路，避免过多的阳光照射，所有这些我都需要注意! 我很高兴回顾那些能帮助我过上更健康生活方式的事情!</p>

<h1 id="常考题">常考题</h1>
<h2 id="work-or-study">Work or Study</h2>
<ol>
<li>Why did you choose that subject?<br>
I am majoring in International Business. I chose my major subject of study based on my aptitude in studying economics, accounting, and languages, my interest in travel, and advice from my parents and teachers. I felt this major area of study would prepare me for a career that I would find interesting and that I could be successful in.</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose business as a subject because it gives me an excellent foundation to enter my desired career upon completion of my studies. It is important for me to take the same career path as my father, as he has had an incredibly successful one, and I would like to emulate that.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Is it interesting?<br>
I truly enjoy my courses because they are so interesting. There are a few courses that are more difficult for me than others, but I find if I put more time and effort into studying, I am able do well in them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, it brings lots of fun. I get quite some time to personally interact with my teachers, enabling me to go into great depth while studying material that I find particularly interesting. In addition, by sharing impressive knowledge on the subject in my online blog, I have attracted thousands of fans. I really love.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What subjects are you studying?<br>
This year, I’m taking advanced classes in Finance, Macroeconomics, English, and Information Technology. I am also taking a class in Modern European History because I thought this would be interesting.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am currently studying both business marketing and psychology as a joint degree. These two courses give me both a theoretical business knowledge on marketing campaigns and practical working skills. It also provides me with a psychological background that allows me to understand the reasons behind various aspects of those topics better.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoon?<br>
I prefer to study in the afternoon. I feel more alert in the afternoon than I do in the morning or the evening. I seem to be able to read, and comprehend more, in less time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compared with many friends who like to study in the afternoons, I prefer to study in the mornings With a g-hour sleep at night, I am very energetic in the mornings, and I can better focus on solving severe problems.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Are you looking forward to working?<br>
I am definitely looking forward to using the things I have learned in school in my career. I’m also looking forward to making money to support myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I am. Even though working can be stressful and challenging, I do enjoy it. However, finishing my studies and starting my career is exciting, as I will have the opportunity to apply what I learned. Besides, with a salary, I can be financially independent, and buy anything I like without worry about my parents rejections.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Do you like your subject?<br>
I love my subject because it is so interesting. I find the more I learn, the more I find interesting about it! I think everything I am learning will be useful in my career.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do, because it directly relates to my desired career path. The subject offers a perspective on the marketing business and interesting knowledge about human psychology. The combination of these two aspects is going to help me open an advertisement business.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>What work do you do?<br>
I recently started as a research assistant at a large international advertising firm. It’s an entry level position where I find statistics about the likes and dislikes of different age groups in a specific country that our client is looking to do business in.</li>
</ol>
<p>I currently work as a marketing assistant at a large company that sells electronic products. In particular, I design advertising posters for the global launch of new products in the Chinese market.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Why did you choose to do that type of work?<br>
While this is not the final job that I was hoping for, it is a solid entry-level position in a firm that does the kind of work I am interested in. I enjoy gathering the statistics knowing that they will be used to make important decisions in marketing our client’s product. I feel there is a lot of room for promotion here in this company as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose this work to follow my fathers footsteps. My father has been working in marketing for his entire life, Since I was very young, my father shared several insights about his work in the form of curious stories. These stories always caught my interest, which later transformed into my passion.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Do you miss being a student?<br>
I didn’t think that I would, but I do.As much as I like my job and I am grateful to have it, it is a big change. I am meeting new people and learning new responsibilities; my daily schedule is very different, but I need to expect a period of adjustment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes and no. I miss the time spent studying with my friends and working towards a standard qualification. However, since finishing my studies, I do prefer the freedom of being able to move on and start my career.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Do you like your job?<br>
I really enjoy my job. I think the work is interesting and look forward to learning more. I like all of the people I work with. There are two other research assistants who were hired the same time I was and I enjoy working with them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I do My job allows me to interact with a variety of people from different backgrounds and cultures every day. I find the work itself to be extremely fulfilling, and I really appreciate the way my efforts get</p>

<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Can you describe the place where you live?<br>
I live in a high rise apartment building on the 5th floor overlooking the street with apartment buildings on either side. We have a balcony where we keep many of our plants and sometimes we’ll sit there in the evening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you live there?<br>
I have lived there for 18 years. I was born there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you live with?<br>
I live with my parents, my sister, and my dog. Sometimes my grandparents or aunt will visit us and they stay with us in our home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you plan to live there for a long time?<br>
I’m hoping after I finish my education, I find a job and I can find my own home. Housing is expensive, so I may be home with my parents longer than I plan to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between where you are living now and where you have lived in the past?<br>
I haven’t lived anywhere else. I have always lived here. My parents lived in a smaller apartment in a building nearby before I was born, but they moved here because they needed more room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?<br>
I prefer living in a flat because it is so much more convenient, and neighbours seem much more friendly. Perhaps I like it because this is what I am accustomed to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the future, what type of place would you like to live in?<br>
I would like to live in a flat on the very top floor of a building. I think it would be quieter and we wouldn’t be able hear as much street noise and the view, especially at night, would be spectacular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of neighbourhood /environment/surroundings/home would you like to live in?<br>
I like living in the city where I am. I like the convenience of being very close to public transportation so I can go where ever I need to go. I like my neighbourhood because we have a variety of young people and old people. It’s our own community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?<br>
We eat, sleep, and basically live together there. When we are all at home, we sometimes do things together, like watching sports on TV, other times we will go to our room to study or listen to music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which room does your family spend most of the time in?<br>
We spend most of our time in the living room. We will watch TV there or play games while lying on the floor. It’s the sunniest room in the house, so it is very pleasant to be in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What part of your home do you like the most?<br>
I like my bedroom the most in my home. I have it decorated to my taste and feel safe and calm whenever I go into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the transport facilities to your home very good?<br>
Absolutely, that’s one of the reasons I like our neighbourhood. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the bus stop and from there, I can get anywhere in the city.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hometown">Hometown</h2>
<p>1.What’s (the name of) your hometown?<br>
I live in Guangzhou. It is located in the Guangdong Province. and is known as the City of Flowers.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Is that a big city or a small place?<br>
It is the third largest city in China. It has a population of over 13 million people. It’s a big place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please describe your hometown a little.<br>
It is the educational and cultural centre of Southern China. It’s also known as the City of Flowers because there are evergreens and flowers in bloom year round because of its climate. It’s a pretty city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you lived there?<br>
I have lived here all of my life, for eighteen years. My parents have lived here all of their lives too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like it?<br>
I like it very much. Of course, this is all I have ever known, but whenever my family travels anywhere, I am always happiest when I return home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like living there?<br>
I like living here because my family is here, my grandparents and aunt live here too. I like the climate because it never gets really cold. I don’t really like all of the rain we get in the summer, but even then, the rain keeps the air cleaner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you like (the most) about your hometown?<br>
I really like the food. The Cantonese food is excellent and there are so many other kinds of international restaurants to try. I also really enjoy Thai food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there anything you dislike about it?<br>
The humidity gets things damp in the house, so we have to use air conditioning a lot of the time. I don’t really like air conditioning, but we don’t have a choice but to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think you will continue living there for a long time? / 10. Do you plan to continue living there? ( Combined two similar questions as one)<br>
I want to go abroad to study after I graduate from high school. I want to see what other cities and countries have to offer and then I’ll decide.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-area-you-live-in">The area you live in</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like the area that you live in?<br>
I love the area that I live in. I am so lucky that we have so much to do which are very close to us! Also, there is public transportation just one block from my building. Everything is so convenient!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some changes in the area recently?<br>
Over the past few years, some new restaurants have opened nearby which make eating out more convenient for everyone in the area. Also, last year, improvements were made to the park near my house. Some older trees were trimmed and some new varieties of trees were planted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you know any famous people in your area?<br>
Well, I really don’t think any famous people live near me. I have never heard of or met any famous person in my neighbourhood. I guess it’s because the area I am living in is an area for middle income families, not for famous people who have much higher salaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do you like to go in that area?<br>
Like I said earlier, there are some new restaurants in the area. They are family-style restaurants, so they are the great places to go with my family for relaxed meals. Also, the park has always been a pleasant place to go. Everything I need or want is within walking distance to my home.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="老题">老题</h1>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<ol>
<li>When do you listen to music?<br>
I listen to music whenever I can. I enjoy listening to music when I'm on public transportation, going to and from school. I also like to listen to music sometimes when I'm studying. It helps to block out things in the background so I'm able to focus better.</li>
</ol>
<p>I listen to music whenever I have an opportunity to do so. This is mainly when I am walking to work in the morning. I love music a lot, as it makes me relaxed and happy.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How much time do you spend listening to music every day?<br>
I hadn't really thought about this until this question. I think I spend about 2 to 3 hours a day. I listen to it on public transportation and then when I study, but not all the time when I study. Sometimes it's distracting when I'm studying, but I would say 2 to 3 hours a day is a fair estimate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting an exact timescale on it is hard. On an average day I would estimate that I listen to music for at least 3 or 4 hours On weekends, I spend even more time, as I like to have relaxing background music throughout the day.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What kinds of music do you like to listen to?<br>
I really enjoy K-pop, the energy and the lyrics, it’s just so lively and makes me feel good. I also like to listen to slower songs that have a deeper story like a ballad or something- a lot of fun to listen to a ballad. I also like to listen to instrumental music where there are no words, I sometimes find that to be very soothing when I'm trying to study</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a very eclectic music taste. Depending on what mood I am in, I can listen to anything from blues and reggae, to rock and metal music. Lately, I have been listening to Pink Floyds quite a lot.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What’s your favourite kind of music?<br>
Without question my favourite music is K-pop. You can't listen to it without enjoying it. It's lively and it makes you feel good and when you're listening to it you're tapping your foot and just getting ready to be excited for the rest of your day. It just always puts me in a good mood.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite kind of music is rock-and-roll. In particular, I like the music by Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath, but I also love newer bands like Avenged Sevenfold. Despite my love for this kind of music, sometimes, I listen to the top pop songs of the moment.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Have you ever been to a concert before?<br>
Sadly, I have not been to a concert, but I'd like to go to one soon. Concerts are expensive but I'm saving up money and I have a few concerts that I have that in mind that I'd like to go to.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been to many concerts in different countries, including the UK and Singapore. I love the feeling I have at a concert where live music is more touching, I was at a concert quite recently, when I went to see Guns and Roses perform in Lisbon.</p>
<h2 id="tea-and-coffee">Tea and coffee</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do Chinese people like to drink tea or coffee?<br>
I think more Chinese people prefer to drink tea than coffee. I know my family does. There are so many more flavours of tea that people can enjoy, and that’s why it is more popular.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think most Chinese people drink both tea and coffee. However, coffee is more common to drink early in the morning, while tea is something you can drink all day long. Tea is a bit of a comforting drink, as well.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you prepare tea or coffee for the guests at home?<br>
I prepare and serve tea for guests at home. My mother will make coffee for the few guests who prefer coffee, because I don’t know how to make it properly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever I have people pay me a visit, I usually make them a cup of tea. This is especially true if they stop by for dinner or simply in the afternoon.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When was the last time you drank tea or coffee?<br>
I drank some green tea this morning. I have tea every morning. When I get home from school, I will often have an herbal tea. I have only tried coffee once, and frankly, I just don’t like it. It tastes very bitter to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to confess, I' ve had tea and coffee today. This morning, I had a latte for breakfast. I also washed my lunch down with a cup of green tea. They were both delicious.</p>
<h2 id="patience">Patience</h2>
<ol>
<li>Were you patient when you were young?<br>
No, I was not patient at all when I was young. I remember having trouble waiting for meals and interrupting my parents for attention when they were busy. I cried and shouted when I was impatient and could not be quiet at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a kid, I was the opposite of patient. It was as tough as nails for me to sit still and wait for anything had to put a lot of work into this aspect of my life.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How do you feel when other people are not patient?<br>
When younger children are impatient, it doesn’t bother me because I understand they are still learning. However, I get upset when older children and adults aren’t patient. It’s important to be respectful of other people.</li>
</ol>
<p>When an adult isnt patient, I find it very frustrating. Impatience only makes a situation more complicated. However, I can't help but empathize with children that have ants in their pants, because they have so much energy.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Were you less or more patience when you are angry?<br>
I am more patient when I am angry. This is because I always walk away until I am calmer. Then, I won’t do or say things that I may regret later. Walking away forces me to be calmer, so then I will be more patient.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'li admit, when I'm angry, my patience often goes out the door. I try to keep my cool, but if I am pushed too far, then I find it hard to deal with situations that require patience.</p>
<h2 id="public-holiday">Public holiday</h2>
<ol>
<li>How many public holidays do you have in China?<br>
There are seven public holidays we can enjoy in China. If it’s counted by days, there are 11 public holidays each year. For some of the Chinese, they can enjoy one or half a day for their own holiday. For example, Chinese women enjoy half a day on Women’s Day.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seven public holidays and China. These holidays include the Spring Festival, National Day and New Year, just to name a few. Of course, each holiday is important to our country, because it celebrates our culture.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you think people need more public holidays?<br>
In my opinion, I think people need more public holidays in China. With more and more work and study burden, Chinese people have less time to enjoy their own hobbies or to attend their family activities nowadays. In addition, more holidays can encourage people to travel more.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we could use more holidays. I love to celebrate with my family, friends and community while enjoying the spirit of a special occasion. Holidays give people the chance to kick back and relax too, which is important.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How do you usually spend your holidays?<br>
Usually I spend my holidays with my family or my friends. I often gather with family at a restaurant for a morning tea or a meal. Sometimes I will go to the cinema with my good friends for a movie. If I have more holidays, I would rather travel with my family or friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, when there is a holiday, my parents and I go to my grandparents' home. Then, we eat a ton of food, play games and enjoy a community event. This often includes setting off and watching fireworks.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which holiday is your favourite?<br>
My favourite holiday, without a doubt, is the Spring Festival which is our Chinese New Year. This is a traditional Chinese festival and it’s the most important holidays for Chinese families. Normally, no matter where we are, we go home to meet our parents and grandparents during these days in a year.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite holiday is the Spring Festival. There is something refreshing about greeting a new year. Plus, I love spending time with family, passing out red envelopes and eating delicious foods.</p>
<h2 id="outdoor">Outdoor</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you prefer to be indoors or outdoors?<br>
Personally, I prefer being outdoors rather than indoors. It feels great to go outside and exercise a bit to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I go to the gym once a week to keep fit and get slimmer. I also do yoga at home for two hours after dinner.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have developed a habit of relaxing indoors, especially on workdays. However, when I am on vacation, the great outdoors is my personal oasis. I can't get enough of the sunshine and scenic views.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Did you like to go outside when you were young?<br>
I loved to go outside when I was young. There was a park nearby my house when I was in primary school, and my parents would often bring me over there to have fun with my friends. We could spend the whole day in the park without getting bored.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I was a kid, I was often tempted to stay indoors and play videogames. Once I worked up the motivation to go outside, I had a blast, though. I always felt much happier after spending the day outdoors.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Did you often go over to your friends’ house when you were young?<br>
Yes, I did. My friends invite me to their houses quite a lot and I’ve developed a good relationship with their parents. They often treat me with food and drinks and chat with me about interesting things about their work. The things I learned from them were fascinating.</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as I was old enough to venture out on my own, I spent a lot of time with my friends. We would take turns going to each others houses, which helped to keep things fresh and exciting.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is it important for children to play outdoors?<br>
I think it’s really important for people to encourage their children to play outdoors. Having some outdoor activities could keep children healthy and strong. Playing outdoors would also help them release some stress that was built during long time studies and school work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Absolutely! Playing outside is a great way for children to get some exercise, learn and use their imagination. Apart from that, fresh air and sunshine are both vital to our health and the best place to get both is outside.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you make plans every day?<br>
Not necessarily. I make plans for myself about things that I must complete each day, and I would mark off any tasks that I’ve completed after doing it. However, I don’t really specify what time I would complete it because it doesn’t really matter to me as long as I complete it in the specified date.</li>
</ol>
<p>I actually tend to wing it most of the time. I would love to be a planner, but usually, things don't go according to plan, which frustrates me greatly. So, I just let things flow naturally.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are you good at managing your time?<br>
I’m pretty good at managing my time. I often estimate the amount of time that’s required to finish a certain task, and save some time between each task as little breaks.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to admit; time management isn't my cup of tea. I tend to space out often and lose track of time. I also work better when I procrastinate, as it forces me to concentrate harder.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the latest plan you’ve made?<br>
Just a few days ago, a childhood friend of mine that I haven’t seen for a long time contacted me on social media， asking me to go to a reunion party and see my old primary school friends at a restaurant. It has been quite some time since we parted ways after graduating primary school, so I made plans with them and wrote it in my agenda.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last plan I made was to go home to visit my grandparents. I hadn't seen them in a little while, so I cleared my schedule and planned out the best travel route to maximize my time with them.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What is the hardest part about making plans?<br>
The hardest part about making plans for me is when something unexpected occurs and disrupts my original plan. I get stood up by some friends sometimes, because they only tell me an hour before the meetups. It’s really hard to adapt to the sudden change in plan, but I manage to work them out in the end.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the hardest aspect of planning is working out the kinks of each plan. You never know what is going to go wrong, so you really have to plan around a bunch of different factors, including the weather.</p>
<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you often use a calculator?<br>
Yes. I do often use a calculator because I feel that it is much faster and convenient when I am doing my Math exercises. Especially when I am solving some complicated algebra questions, a functional calculator can be used as a useful tool for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ever since I figured out there is a calculator on my smartphone, I tend to use it freauently. It especially comes in handy when I'm shopping, as it allows me to calculate my purchases before checking out.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are girls generally good at mathematics?<br>
General speaking, girls are not as good as boys at mathematics, especially in the past. But nowadays, there are more and more girls who are interested in the field of Science and Engineering. Some of them are better than boys in the Math study and even at their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel that girls are just as good at math as boys are. However, for years, there was a stigma about mathematics and girls. So, many girls didn't put in the effort needed to excel in the subject.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you think it is difficult to learn mathematics well?<br>
Yes. To learn mathematics well requires at least three main factors: interest, diligence, and some degree of abilities in abstract thinking and understanding. This is because compared with other subjects, Math involves more abstract concepts and logical inferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematics can be a challenging subject. However, I feel that a person's motivation as well as the teachers they have throughout their education plays an important role in how they view the subiect.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think mathematics is important?<br>
Mathematics is an important basic course for students to study because it educates and trains students for their comprehensive ability in abstract thinking, analysis and deduction. It is also the basic tool of the study in all science and engineering. And it plays an important role in the development of human society and propels the society forward.</li>
</ol>
<p>Absolutely. Mathematics not only helps people to understand so much about the world, but it is also a necessity for the future. Without this subject, we would not have the technology or knowledge that we do today.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like travelling?<br>
Yes, I really enjoy travelling, especially by myself. It’s a great way to release all the stress built up at school. I go on some trips to different cities nearby every year during the summer break. I book and order all the tickets and flights by myself, and it’s more affordable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which cities have you travelled to?<br>
I’ve been to places like Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing. I enjoyed all the sceneries and food during my trip. I’m still a student, I can’t afford to go to other countries and travel by myself. But I’ve been to Kyoto, Japan with my parents. It was a great family trip and we had a lot of fun there together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of cities do you like to travel to?<br>
I like going to the cities that I could try a lot of delicious food. I really enjoy trying out different food from different cities and experiencing the diffident cultures from places. You could also learn about the histories of places as you have the food. A lot of food such as stinky tofu can date back to Ancient China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the place that left you the deepest impression when travelling?<br>
Japan is probably the most impressive country I’ve ever been to. The clean streets and the politeness of the people have left me the deepest impressions. There was absolutely no garbage that was left on the ground, and all the places I’ve been to were extremely clean and tidy. People were also very polite when they interact with each other.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="market">Market</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do street markets sell?<br>
Out of all the street markets I’ve been to, almost all of them sell authentic Chinese street food, such as stinky tofu in Hunan, Changfen in Guangdong and other foods that are special in each continent. Street food are usually made to order and offered in smaller sizes for your convenience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there many street markets in China?<br>
There are quite a lot of street markets in China. If you go out on the streets in the middle of the night, you could see hundreds of people still sitting on the side of the streets, savouring the snacks they’ve bought from the vendors. It’s an unspoken tradition for people to have midnight snacks in China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the differences between street markets and supermarkets?<br>
Supermarkets tend to sell food that’s made using machines, such as frozen foods and boxed snacks. However, if you go to a local street market in China, you could find tons of homemade and authentic Chinese street food sold in different vendors. They are also cheaper than the frozen food sold in the supermarkets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you often go to the supermarkets?<br>
I do. Even though supermarkets have a lot of frozen foods in the freezers, they still sell fresh produces. Living alone as a student, I go to the supermarkets once every week to stock up fresh produces in my fridge. I make most of my meals every week, other than the times where I’m incredibly tired after school</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do you think makes good friends<br>
I think the most important thing about a good friend is the sincerity. If you want to become a good friend, it’s important to actually be sincere in this relationship, and don’t hesitate to show your genuineness to your friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you keep in contact with friends from your childhood?<br>
I’m actually not in contact with my friends from my childhood anymore. I have their contacts on social media, and I see their posts once in a while, however, we don’t message one another anymore, because it has been so long since the last time I talked to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of people do you like to make friends with?<br>
I like to make friends with people who are energetic and playful. I enjoy having company so I won’t get too bored during the days. I also like making friends with people who have the same interest as me, because it helps create more topics when having conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think you are a good friend or others?<br>
I think I am a good friend to others, because I am cheerful and I don’t get angry easily. I often joke around with friends, and I’m usually the mood-maker in my group of friends. So I think my friends love to have my company.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What’s your favourite movie?<br>
I have quite a lot of favorite movies, but my most favorite movie would definitely be Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse. It has great graphics and plot, which makes it suitable for all ages to watch. I’ve watched it over five times since it came out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do your friends like this movie?<br>
Of course, all of my friends who watched it told me they loved it. I went to watch this movie with a friend, and after the movie, we couldn’t stop talking about how great the animation and graphics were, and how beautiful the plot and character settings were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of movies do you think young people like<br>
I think young people would like movies that have more action and drama. These genres tend to allow young adults to stay focused on the movie, because it’s exciting and attention-grabbing. Movies like a documentary would probably put young people to sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you want to be a movie star?<br>
I used to want to become a movie actor when I was young. I was featured in a school play back when I was in primary school. However, I don’t think I have the ability to become a movie star now that I’ve grown up, and I have no experience in acting ever since elementary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="animals">Animals</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have you ever kept pets?<br>
I once had a poodle when I was in primary school. I named her Kuro, which means Black in Japanese. She was only six months old when it joined our family. Unfortunately, we had to send her away after a few weeks, because we noticed my mom getting allergic reactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like to go to the zoo?<br>
I really like to go to the zoo, because I get to see rare animals that people don’t often see in their daily lives. It’s awesome to see different animals that I’ve never seen before, and every time I go to the zoo, I realise that there’s way more animals in this world than I imagined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you ever seen any wild animals before?<br>
I’ve seen a wild red fox when I was on a vacation with my mom to Canada. My mom and I were talking and taking a stroll that day, and we stopped talking and stood in shock when we saw the fox, casually walking past us on a street, only a few meters away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What wild animals do you like most?<br>
I really like clouded leopards (云豹). Clouded leopards are medium sized cats that are beautiful and majestic. They don’t have strong roars like some of the big cats, which makes them cute at the same time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What languages can you speak?<br>
I speak Chinese and English. Chinese is my first language and English is my second language. I’ve been trying to learn a little Japanese by myself during the summer break, but I haven’t progressed much, because I don’t have a lot of Japanese friends to have conversations with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is difficult to learn a new language?<br>
I think it’s not that difficult to learn a new language. The most important thing about learning a new language is to practice. I like to learn a new language by watching TV and having conversations with friends. It doesn’t matter if you can’t speak fluently yet, because mistakes help you grow faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you learn other languages in the future?<br>
I wish I could learn Japanese in the future. I’ve been checking out a lot of videos about the different cultures in Japan, and I wish to go to Japan on a vacation in the future. Learning Japanese before going on the trip would come in handy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you learn English?<br>
I learn English because English has become the most spoken language on the planet, it has become a universal language. By learning English, I would be able to speak decent English with people from other countries without expressing my message incorrectly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="voice">Voice</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Has your voice ever changed?<br>
My voice had changed quite hard as I grew up. My voice used to be pretty high pitched when I was young, but as I grew up, it started getting deeper and deeper. In the end, my voice turned quite deep, which is very different compared to my voice when I was young.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you enjoy recording your voice and listening to it?<br>
I don’t really listen to my voice in a recording, because it sounds a lot different to how I actually sound in real life. I find that voice recordings tend to make my voice go higher pitched, which sounds really cute, and I’m actually not really used to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like your own voice?<br>
I really like my own voice. When I talk slowly with confidence, I think it gives an impression to people that I’m mature and thoughtful. I also like singing because I like my own voice; however, I never record my own singing because it sounds really weird in recordings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does your voice sound similar to your parents?<br>
Surprisingly, my voice sounds nothing like my parents. My mom has a really high-pitched tone, while my dad has a mediocre voice that’s not really deep. My parents often joked that I didn’t sound like their kid back when I was in high school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="concentration">Concentration</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When do you need to be focused?<br>
Currently I need to focus on my university study. Since my major is visual arts, I need to spend most of the time on projects and homework. Concentration on study is my priority for these four years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What many distract you when you are trying to stay focused?<br>
To be honest, too much chatting online with friends is distracting me when I am trying to stay focused on my school study. Wechat is a good communication tool for today’s young generation, however, I am trying to control the time I spend on it every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you do to help you concentrate?<br>
In order to keep my concentration on study, I usually shut down my cellphone or go to the library to study for a few hours. Besides, I often find a study room at school where no friends can find me. In this way, I can focus on my homework by myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it difficult for you to stay focused on something?<br>
Yes. When there are so many friends chatting with me online or hanging out together, it is difficult for me to stay focused on my study. When I am captivated with my favourite animation, I cannot concentrate on my homework at home. In general, I have difficulty to stay focused on something for a long time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="jeans">Jeans</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you wear jeans?<br>
Yes. I usually wear jeans when I hang out with my friends. We often go for hiking, dancing and seeing movies during our holidays. Wearing jeans is a kind of fashion trend for today’s young generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you wear jeans?<br>
I often wear jeans at weekends, especially every Saturday. Since Saturday is a leisure time for me to relax after a week’s study at school. During my vacations and holidays, I also like to wear jeans to go travel with my family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like wearing jeans, why?<br>
I like wearing jeans because it shows my body figure perfectly. And it is also a fashion trend for our young generation. I also like wearing jeans because they’re stylish. Furthermore, they are always leading the trend of the casual wears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you think jeans are popular in China?<br>
In China, people like to wear jeans in all kinds of occasions, formal and informal, weekdays and weekends, indoors and outdoors. The other reason I think jeans are popular in China is because people from older to younger generations like to wear jeans no matter if it is in winter or in summer. And there are a lot of stores and shops selling jeans everywhere in China.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="haircut">Haircut</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What’s your favourite hairstyle?<br>
My favourite hairstyle is short straight hair. Since I am living in Southern China, it is extremely hot in summer. And I sweat a lot when it is hot. So a short straight hair style is suitable and favourable to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you have your hair cut?<br>
My short straight hair style helps me to avoid going to the barber, so I go much less than my friends. I only have my hair cut every two weeks. Since I am currently studying in the university, I do not have too much money and time to keep changing my hairstyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much do you usually spend on your haircut?<br>
I usually spend only one hundred yuan a month for my haircut. Every two weeks, it costs me fifty yuan to go to barber. It is a reasonable price for a simple hair cut nowadays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you often change your haircut?<br>
No. I am not keen on changing my hairstyle, especially as I am a student currently. I need to concentrate on my school study all the time so that I can find a good job after graduation. Then I will think about changing my haircut or hairstyle more often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you had your current haircut?<br>
I have had my current haircut for at least two years since I entered into the university. I would like to focus on the study instead of my appearance for the coming two years in the school. And this is also because the weather in Guangzhou is terribly hot in summer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you ever had an unhappy haircut?<br>
Yes. I remember that in the summer vacation during my high school I was unhappy with my haircut. I was going back to my hometown with my parents. Since it is in the countryside, it is really hard for me to find a good barber. So I had to accept what the only barber in the village had done to my hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like to have your hair cut?<br>
Yes. I do like to have my hair cut. But I do not like to change my hairstyle too often. My favourite hairstyle is the short straight hair, and I do not like to have my hair dyed into other colours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="walking">Walking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you walk a lot?<br>
I do not walk a lot because I am not very interested in outdoor activities. In fact, I enjoy indoor exercises, such as Yoga, Aerobics and table tennis. I would like to take a walk only if I have eaten too much at dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you walk more often than in the past?<br>
No. Since I am studying visual arts in the university, I have less time to go out for a walk. A lot of projects and homework I have to work on not only in the day, but also at night. I spend a lot of time on shopping, chatting and studying online instead of any outdoor activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people will walk more or not in the future?<br>
I think more and more people will walk less in the future. With the development of AI and different kinds of apps in cellphones, people do not need to walk more to get what they want. They can order everything online, meeting and chatting with friends by video calls. AI will meet their needs for indoor and outdoor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do you usually take a walk?<br>
I usually take a walk in the park near my home. The park is a small but clean place for people to spend their leisure time, especially for the older generation. I like to take a walk over there because my parents like to be with me while they take a walk after dinner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="countryside">Countryside</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like to live in countryside in the future?<br>
Yes. Although I am currently living in the city, I still like would to move to the countryside someday when I have my own family. This is because I would like to have a bigger space and a clean and healthy living environment for my baby to grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would you like to do in the countryside?<br>
Living in the countryside, I would like to farm my own vegetable in my backyard so that I can eat healthy foods planted by myself every day. And I would like to raise and walk a dog in the field instead of keeping it at home. The most important thing I would like to do in the countryside is to breathe the fresh air while I am doing exercises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long have you lived in countryside?<br>
To be honest, I have only lived in countryside for a few days. It was because I went to my hometown to see my cousin with my parents. When I saw the green field, beautiful flowers and the little hill behind our old house in the countryside, I was attracted by the peaceful, quiet and healthy living environment over there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the benefits of living in rural areas?<br>
Living in rural areas, you can breathe the fresh air, have a bigger living space and healthier food than living in the cities. Besides, you can also have a quiet and peaceful quality of life. Less people and less pollution are also the advantages of living in rural areas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="新题">新题</h1>
<h2 id="scenery">Scenery</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is there good scenery in your hometown?<br>
Yes, of course. There are many famous tourist attractions in my hometown, such as the Canton Tower, Pearl River and Baiyun Mountain. But I have been to these places so many times that they are not as attractive to me anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you travel, do you like to live in hotels with scenic views?<br>
No, I don’t. Because the hotels with scenic views are usually very expensive. I can go to the scenery in the daytime even though it will take me a little time to get there. I think staying in expensive hotels is a high cost way to travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like to take pictures of good scenery with your smartphone? Why?<br>
I like to use my smartphone to take pictures. My Huawei P30 has incredible photography functions. While on the journey, I always use my Huawei cellphone to take pictures for my friends. All of them are always astonished by the good effects of the pictures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there good scenery in cities?<br>
It depends. I think a skyline of skyscrapers is good scenery which I appreciate. But some people don’t, they may consider natural landscape as the best kind of scenery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pen-and-pencil">Pen and pencil</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you usually use pen and pencil?<br>
No, I seldom use pen or pencil because I like to use the computer to read and do my study. I think typing through the computer is more convenient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which do you use more often? Pen or pencil?<br>
Pen, of course. The cartridge of the pencil is so fragile that it often breaks off easily. However, pen is much more durable, even if you drop it to the ground many times, it still works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was the last time you bought a pen or pencil?<br>
I don’t remember actually. Now I have several pens on hand. All of them were given as a present in school activities. So, I haven’t bought a pen for long time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think if someone gives you a pen or pencil as a present?<br>
I think it is old-fashion way to give a pen or pencil as a present. If someone did that, I would accept it, but I wouldn’t be happy about that.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="spend-time-by-yourself">Spend time by yourself</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like to be alone?<br>
I like to be alone. It seems to be a strange answer, but I truly like to be alone because I can do whatever I want. I can enjoy playing computer games and watching movies without being disturbed by others when I am alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was the last time you were alone and what did you do then?<br>
Maybe last weekend. When I came back home, I found that my parents were out. So, I tidied up my room and turned on the TV to watch some TV programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you always do when you are alone?<br>
I usually watch movies when I am alone. Because I think it makes me feel comfortable to turn off all of lights in my room and watch a nice movie. That is the way life should be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you usually spend your time by yourself?<br>
Like I said above, when I am home alone, I like to watch movies. But on a nice day, I also enjoy reading a book or exercising outside.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="laugh">Laugh</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are you the kind of person who makes people laugh?<br>
No, I am not the kind of person who can amuse others. I find it difficult to find common topics to communicate with others. But I like to keep company with this kind of person!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like to watch movies or TV shows that make people laugh?<br>
Yes, I do. Often at the end of a long day or a long week, I am in need of a lot of rest. So, I often relax by watching comedies which relieve my anxiety and tiredness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you usually make your friends laugh?<br>
No, I am not the kind of person who can amuse others. Some people can find humor in everything and share it freely. I do not have an outgoing personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think it is important to laugh with friends?<br>
Yes, I think it is important. If you don’t laugh with your friends, they may consider you to be unsociable and aloof.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="water-sports">Water sports</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are water sports popular in China?<br>
No, I don’t think so. I think many people don’t have a chance to play water sports in their hometown. On one hand, water sports are expensive in cities where they are available, on the other hand, not all cities have water sports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you done any water sports?<br>
I have done some, but not many. When I travelled to Phuket Island, I played on a banana boat and snorkeled. They were really exciting and relaxing sports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What water sports do you like doing?<br>
I like snorkeling, although I have not snorkeled many times. It is an easy way to explore the ocean and doesn’t require complex skills. All I need to do it is to wear the suit and snorkeling mask and use the breathing tube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of water sports do you want to try?<br>
I want to try deep diving. Because compared to snorkeling, deep diving would let me go deeper and see more sea creatures, such as turtles and crabs. However, deep diving requires certain skills, which take time to practice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like running?<br>
Yes, of course. Running is my favourite sport. I usually run 5 kilometers every day. It is a kind of aerobic exercise which can improve our cardiovascular health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you go for a run?<br>
Like I said earlier. I usually run for 5 kilometers every day. I like to go running first thing in the morning because I start the day feeling more relaxed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do you usually go running?<br>
I usually go to the university stadium to run. The stadium has a nice track and not many people use it in the morning. So, I usually go there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think running is a good way to stay healthy?<br>
It has been proven that running is a kind of aerobic exercise which can improve our cardiovascular health. I enjoy running very much and I think it is a good way to relieve stress.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="arts">Arts</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is there any artwork on the wall in your room?<br>
Yes, I have an oil painting on the wall in my room. It depicts a beautiful scenery of Fuji Mountain which I have been to before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you ever visited an art gallery?<br>
No. I haven’t. I am not good at art and don’t really have an interest in it, so I haven’t been to an art gallery before. But I like to listen to music. Thus, I have been to many concerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like art?<br>
No, I don’t. Compared to art, I like music more because music has a power of healing. Whenever I feel tired or anxious, I like to listen to some relaxing music.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cake">Cake</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you like eating cakes?<br>
Yes, of course I love eating cakes. Doesn’t everyone? My favourite is mixed fruit cake. But I don’t like to eat those cakes with lots of cream. I like the fruit and chocolate cakes more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you ever made cakes?<br>
No, I haven’t. I am not that kind of person who is good at baking things. So, I haven’t tried to make cakes and I don’t think I will make cakes in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What desserts do Chinese people like?<br>
I think many people like to eat sweets because they are cheap and easy to buy. Sweets come in many flavours and can satisfy many people's tastes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like dessert?<br>
Yes. My favourite food is mixed fruit cake and chocolate cake. Although they are a high sugar and fatty food, I still can't help craving dessert every day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Did you like history when you were young?<br>
I liked history, but I disliked the history class. I think history is the most boring subject that I have ever taken. There is no skill to learn it. All that you need to do is to remember, remember and remember.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was the last time you read about history?<br>
I follow the topic of history in my Daily News App, so it will push me to read many interesting historical stories every day. It is very good App and I enjoy the history stories in it. The stories are brief, but I can get more information if I am interested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you ever been to historical museum?<br>
Yes, I have been to many historical museums. The biggest one that I have been to is the Forbidden City. But I think the most interesting historical museum is the Xi’An Historical Museum because Xi 'An has a long history and many stories took place in Xi 'An. Many important people were born and lived there, as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="science-class">Science class</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you think science classes are important?<br>
I think they are very important, especially for children. Science class can arouse students' curiosity and cultivate their ability to explore the unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you have science class in primary school or high school?<br>
Yes, I did have science classes in primary school. Science class was always full of fun because the teacher would tell us many interesting facts about the natural world. She always presented the information in an engaging way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like science class?<br>
Yes, I like it very much. Science class is always interesting because I enjoy thinking about science and nature. I think my primary school teacher encouraged me to want to learn more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of science did you do at school?<br>
Actually, I don’t remember exactly what I have learned in science classes in primary school, but I remember they were fun. In high school, I particularly enjoyed my science class in Biology.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="break">Break</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How often do you take a break?<br>
I usually take a ten-minute break once every hour from whatever work I am doing. It is very essential for me so I can unwind and refocus on my task again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you need to take a break?<br>
I think people need to take a break to relax so that they can recharge and focus on their task at hand again. Otherwise, they may feel tired and run out of energy. In a way, taking breaks enhance people’s working efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you usually do during a break?<br>
I usually close my eyes to relax or l go out to breathe some fresh air. Sometimes, I will get myself a cup of tea or coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer long break or several short breaks?<br>
I prefer one long break than several short breaks. Because several short breaks can easily distract people from staying focused on one thing. With long breaks, I can concentrate on my task to avoid making mistakes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="number">Number</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are you good at math?<br>
I think I am quite good at math. Math is my favourite subject and I spend a lot time studying it. Among all of the aspects of Math, I am very skillful at finding the solutions to geometric problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you usually use numbers?<br>
I usually use numbers in my day to day life. Everything we do in our lives normally requires a little bit of math and numbers. So, mathematics plays an important role in the real world and I think it is the one of the most useful subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you good at remembering phone numbers?<br>
I have to say I am not good at remembering phone numbers. I only remember the phone numbers of my parents and my boyfriend. This is because I usually use WeChat to video call my friends, so there is no need for me to remember their phone numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What ‘s your favourite number?<br>
It must be 14. It was my student ID from my primary school to high school. It is very amazing that this was my number as my student for so many years, because the students IDs are usually given to students by the rank of their entrance exam scores.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="park">Park</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you prefer natural parks or amusement parks?<br>
I prefer natural parks. I love the feeling of peace and calm that I can find at a natural park. Though there are tons of fun things to do in an amusement park, I would be happier to take a walk in a forest or beside a lake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people like going to parks?<br>
There isn’t much open space in the city, all the buildings are close together and living spaces are tight. A park is a brilliant place to escape these things and it can help people unwind and relax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What activities can be done in a park?<br>
There are many activities that can be done in a park, such as playing badminton or football. But Chinese people especially like to do square dancing in the park. When the night falls, many retired people go to the parks, turn on the radio and start to square dance with the rhythm of music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you often go to a park?<br>
Not very often. However, whenever I feel anxious or something bad happens, I will go to the park to unwind. A park is a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and the things that annoy me.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <updated>2020-01-09T07:14:34.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>必须要承认，我一直都不是书虫类型的人，以前看书大部分是为了考试，其余的，顶多也就是看一些畅销书，消磨时光罢了。未曾想，随着年龄越来越大，竟然慢慢可以从看书中找寻到一直渴望的内心的平静。陆陆续续的，也看了一些书，看的时候，思绪万千，想到了很多，可是人又是那么的健忘，看完之后，很快便忘了七七八八。所以，在2020年的伊始，立一个flag，每个月至少写一篇书评吧（以后打脸了再说），就算是记录一下自己的成长。希望一年，或者两年后回看，能够感受到自己的时光没有白白流逝，而是转化为文字，记录了下来，即使一开始如同中学生作文那般稚嫩。</p>
<p>其实这本书我在2019年12月就已经看完了，但是迟迟不敢下笔写书评，或许是恐惧吧，毕竟已经那么长时间不曾正儿八经地输出自己的想法，怕没什么可写的，也怕写的乱七八糟，不像样子。就是鸵鸟一样，藏着，假装这样别人就不知道我的浅薄了。后来发现自己想的太多了，互联网上的内容那么多，又有多少人会注意到我；人们都是那么得忙，谁会管我的文字是否成熟。这样安慰过自己以后，就释然了，不再战战兢兢的，决定提笔写写自己的想法。</p>
<p>一开始看这本书纯属偶然，不过是一本学习英语的app送的，拿到手以后看着封面挺有趣的，就打开了。看之前完全不知道到底是什么类型的，梗概是什么，后来发现，这样也好，刚好可以检验一下是否这本书对我的胃口。实践出真知，我并不喜欢，尽管这本书在2014年荣获亚马逊Best Book的第一。</p>
<p>这本书以一个小姑娘莉迪亚的死展开，然后抽丝剥茧式的，分析一个普通却又不普通的美国家庭中存在的问题， 聊到了，教育，婚姻，种族。说它普通，是因为其实并没有什么轰轰烈烈又转折的情节，除了一开始的“案件”给了一些悬疑的背景，可是后来发现这个“案件”竟是意外而已；说它不普通，因为故事的背景设置在上世纪七十年代，美国中部俄亥俄州的一个小镇，而且这个家庭是种族通婚。莉迪亚的母亲是一个漂亮又平凡的美国白人，父亲詹姆斯是中国的二代移民。 放在现代可能不怎么会吸引人的目光了，但是美国的最高法院于1967年才通过了反异族通婚法，在此之前，不同种族之间结婚是违反法律的行为，因此，这个跨种族的结合才显得那么的不同。</p>
<p>这本书涉及到的可聊的内容还是蛮多的，但是其中最触动我的是两个，一个是詹姆斯那么执着的想要的“融入”，另一个是玛丽琳对女儿的“爱”。他们两个把自己的期许，不加掩饰地压在了莉迪亚的身上，当然也采用了父母最常用的说法—为了你好，如此沉甸甸，像两个又浓又密的翅膀，莉迪亚被包裹在里面，挣扎不得，直到最后窒息在其中。私以为这种爱最为无耻且自私，将下一代作为自己希望的延续却不曾想过自己的下一代首先是要有完整的独立人格存在于世，自己的爱好，自己的想法，自己的未来。继而联想到曾经看到过的一段话，若是父母在生我之前可以问我一下，我坚决选择不要来到这个世上。这句话，引起了我强烈的共鸣，尤其是最近这几个月，我越来越绝望，对这个社会，找不到自己存在的意义。</p>
<p>所谓融入<em>so-called blend in</em><br>
在本书中，詹姆斯一直想要可以真正地融入到美国主流环境，其源头来自于他的童年经历，虽出生且生长在美国，但是却从未被当成过是“美国人”，主要还是因为他的肤色，总是可以让他显得那么的与众不同，当然不是正面的不同。在上学的时候，他是学校里唯一的一个亚裔，他所有的一切都会引起其他人的好奇。他在研究着学业而他的同学们在研究着他，他的瞳孔的颜色。或许他的同学真的只是好奇而已，但是却给年幼的他带来了心理上的阴影。若是他可以明白，那真的不是他的肤色带来的问题，多好。因为，很有可能，其他的小伙伴们研究他是像研究没有见过的物品一样，记得在我小时候，我那四十八线的小村庄来了一个外国人采风，结果差不多半个村子的人都快要围上去了，都想看看那个金发碧眼的外国人。我不感觉当时围上去的人全都是有恶意的，估计他们也不知道自己的举动会不会影响到别人。</p>
<p>詹姆斯在哈佛教学的时候，他所教的科目是<em>The cowboy in American culture</em>.第一节课上，在看到授课老师竟然是一个其貌不扬且瘦弱的亚裔以后，大部分的学生立刻选择了换课，其中还有当着他的面走出教室的。我想，他们应该都会感觉这是一个笑话，一个亚裔，来教美国文化。最有趣的是，玛丽琳一开始震惊与詹姆斯的英语如此之好，竟然都没有口音。当然后来，她也是被这个东方男人的“不同”给吸引到的。这里，我不能说这些学生没有恶意，他们只是没有脑子罢了。可是这些事，脱去种族的外衣，依然存在，就像我来自一个村到不能再村的地方，很多人会以为我的英语会带着极强的地方特色，有的时候，也会想要看我的笑话。</p>
<p>詹姆斯极力摆脱着肤色的不同给他带来的心理上的烙印，甚至来说，他厌恶自己的肤色带来的一系列不同。在学校读书的时候，他拒绝父母接送他，这样同学们就不会看到他的父母。他不会读写中文，当然内心也十分抗拒去学。同时，他拒绝吃中餐，宁愿吃一直被中国留学生吐槽的难吃到极点的冷三明治。在学校里，他不选跟亚洲或者亚洲文化有关的课程，而选择基本跟东方毫无联系的的—<em>cowboy</em>。无非，就是想要别人认为他是一个“美国人”罢了。作为社会中的一员，想要“融入，”基本上可以算是一种本能反应了。我们到了一个新的环境，总是会不自觉的想要去找跟我们有相同或者类似经历的小伙伴，性别，家乡，爱好，等等。好像这样，我们就不会感到孤单。这样的融入，会给我们带来什么什么好处呢？内心上的安全感？朋友？资源？关系网？</p>
<p>而一个人到底能不能融入，感受会受到内外和外在的双重影响，有些人自己本身就不爱跟别人交流，或者性格上的孤僻不是大众喜爱的那个类型，有的或许是周围环境的问题，并不一定是自己不愿踏出那一步。可是，我想问的是，扪心自问一下，难道我们自己就很“融入”自己目前所在的环境中吗？即使没有受到文化，种族这些问题的影响。摸摸我的良心，我感觉不是的，从小时候到现在，一直都不是什么受欢迎那种类型的人，没有什么朋友，一直都感觉自己像是游走在群体的边缘，我不理解他们，他们也不理解我。所以，我个人感觉，即使在相同的肤色，文化中，依然会存在无法融入的问题。在本书中，玛丽琳就是很好的例子，即使身为美国白人，她依然面临着同样的问题，没有什么朋友，无法做到所谓的融入。当然她没有经历过别人研究她的瞳孔颜色这么荒谬的事儿，但是不代表她没有经历过别的研究。</p>
<p>那么如果不能融入，又该如何呢？感觉这个，会像是一个自我救赎的过程。诚然，人乃群居性动物，但是我认为也要认识到，有的时候，不能融入，没有关系，重要的是要明白其实就算是所谓那个“圈子”里的人，也不见得快乐，不见得能够解决掉所有的问题，重要的还是自己的内心强大。就像为什么被研究的詹姆斯会非常敏感，而我的小镇上出现过的那个外国人应该不会有呢？的确，我没有问过那个外国人本人，但是有问过有相同经历的外国人。他们给我的回复是，感觉哪些村民们很有趣—没有见过世面的有趣。那么反过来想，当时研究詹姆斯的人，不也是这样的吗？</p>
<p>亲密暴力<em>IPV-intimate partner violence</em><br>
这个词是我在看完书以后才接触到的，它的意思是现任或前任配偶或伴侣针对另一位配偶或伴侣的亲密关系中的家庭暴力。其形式有多种，身体，言语，精神，经济和性虐待。如果单单根据定义，感觉把玛丽琳的“爱”定义为亲密暴力似乎不妥，但是再仔细琢磨一下，感觉也算属于其中。玛丽琳利用了女儿对她的爱从而达到了操控女儿的目的。</p>
<p>所有的一开始起源于玛丽琳想要回到自己曾经为自己定下的那个人生轨迹中去，上医学院，然后成为一名医生。然而她的行程断在了遇到了詹姆斯，怀孕，辍学。在母亲去世时，她去整理遗物，不经意间翻到了母亲的那本食谱，翻着翻着，突然感觉母亲的一生，留下的印迹似乎不过是如何做好饭，这个想法使她震惊，因为现在的她，正在同样的道路上。然后她像被闪电劈了一样，不断地告诉自己，“<em>I will never end up like that</em>”。然后，在辍学多年后，她决定重新开始自己中断的学业。</p>
<p>我非常欣赏她的勇气和想法，但是确实完全无法理解她的做法。因为她几乎是完全抛弃了剩下的父子三人，独自离开了家。可能在我幼稚的想法里，她可以先考虑跟詹姆斯聊聊，虽然很有可能詹姆斯不支持，不理解，但是至少可以让他知道你的想法。或者实在是理念上不同了，离婚再开始。完全没有必要让他们有那种悬着的感觉。当然最后玛丽琳还是没有回到她想要的轨迹上，因为她又怀孕了。而她这次非常自私且不负责任的做法给自己的孩子们，尤其是莉迪亚造成了极大的恐惧。莉迪亚太害怕回再次失去母亲了，于是从这次事件以后，便对母亲说的所有都说yes.而玛丽琳，彻彻底底得利用了女儿对她的爱，利用了女儿不过是想要一个母亲的渴望。</p>
<p>可是，如果玛丽琳一开始可以想通，自己的生活是自己的，但是女儿也有属于女儿自己的生活，而不是完全把自己的想法强加到莉迪亚身上，是不是就不会有后面悲剧的发生。她是如此的自私，利用，裹挟着女儿的懂事，肆意挥霍着女儿对她的爱，直到最后女儿再也无法承受这份爱。书的最后，她看到了女儿偷偷留下了她以为自己已经扔掉的那本食谱，发现了女儿全部是因为爱她才答应了她所有的要求。在那个时候，我这个旁观者，多么的希望这个懂事的孩子可以像其她的青春期的女孩子那样，叛逆一下，不要那么听父母的话，多好。</p>
<p>看书的时候，想起了有一段时间，网上炒的沸沸扬扬的关于papi酱人生重要人物顺序的那个问题，我个人完全同意papi的想法，一个人连自我的都没有的时候，谈何爱其他人，即使爱，说不定也是带着私欲的爱。如果没有了自我，全部都是为了别人，那么你存在的意义，到底是什么？？多么希望父母可以不要把自己的孩子作为自己的私有财产，不要那么的随意控制，胁迫他们选择自己的人生道路。而孩子们，争点气，不要被别人胁迫，好吗？</p>

不管是在原因中还是最新的一个话题中，都有对累的描述，我们需要积累不同的表达方式，这样才可以避免重复。<br>

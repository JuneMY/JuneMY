        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>I'm tired.</strong><br>
不管是在原因中还是最新的一个话题中，都有对累的描述，我们需要积累不同的表达方式，这样才可以避免重复。<br>
当然，还需要注意好用法额～</p>
<p><strong>加副词来表示程度</strong><br>
<em>I'm very tired.</em><br>
<em>I'm kind of tired.</em><br>
<em>He is pretty tired.</em><br>
<em>I am unbelievably tired.</em><br>
<em>She is mentally tired.</em><br>
<em>We are physically tired.</em><br>
<em><strong>I'm dead tired.</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>I’m dog-tired.</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>I’m tired to the bone.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="im-exhausted">I'm exhausted.</h1>
<p>The word &quot;exhausted&quot; means very tired.<br>
I am exhausted.<br>
<em>She felt exhausted after the game.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-beat">I'm beat.</h1>
<p>This is a common expression to say that we are tired. We only use this in casual situations.</p>
<h1 id="i-am-drained">I am drained.</h1>
<p>drain本身是排水的意思<br>
在这里的用法很形象，你被抽干了，那自然就很累了<br>
<em>We have been working so much. I am drained.</em><br>
<em>I feel drained after working all weekend.</em></p>
<p>draining  adj.<br>
同样的意思，但是主语不一样<br>
在这里主语应该是物<br>
causing you to lose most of your energy; very tiring<br>
<em>He found the funeral service emotionally draining.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-wiped-out">I'm wiped out.</h1>
<p>similar to &quot;I'm drained&quot;</p>
<h1 id="im-worn-out">I'm worn out.</h1>
<p>需要注意的是，这个短语用来表示在工作了很久以后很累<br>
<em>I have worked every day for the last 3 months. I'm worn out.</em><br>
<em>We have been so busy this week. I am worn out.</em><br>
<em>We also use the phrase &quot;worn out&quot; with clothes or things that we have used for a long long time and now their condition is not good.</em><br>
<em>I have been wearing these shoes for 2 years. They are worn out.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-burnt-out">I'm burnt out.</h1>
<p>This expression is only used to show that we are tired because of doing something over a long period of time. All of our energy has been used up. This expression has the feeling that we have lost our passion or desire to do something.<br>
<em>I have worked overtime every day for the past month. I am burnt out.</em><br>
<em>I think I need a vacation. I feel burnt out.</em><br>
<em>Remember that we cannot use this with short-term things.</em><br>
<em>I ran for an hour today. I am burnt out.</em><br>
<em>I ran for an hour today. I am exhausted.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-fried">I'm fried.</h1>
<p>It means that I am so tired, that my brain is fried. So, we are so tired that we cannot think well.</p>
<h1 id="im-spent">I'm spent.</h1>
<p>This means that we have spent all of our energy. Therefore, we feel tired.</p>
<h1 id="i-am-weary">I am weary.</h1>
<p>&quot;Weary&quot; is a more formal word that means tired. We are more likely to see this in books and writing.</p>
<h1 id="im-whacked">I’m whacked.</h1>
<h1 id="im-on-my-last-legs">I’m on my last legs.</h1>
<h1 id="im-bushed">I’m bushed.</h1>
<h1 id="im-knackered">I’m knackered.</h1>
<h1 id="im-flat-out-tired">I’m flat out tired.</h1>
<h1 id="im-dead-on-my-feet">I’m dead on my feet.</h1>
<h1 id="im-running-on-empty">I’m running on empty.</h1>
<p>#I’m running on fumes.</p>
<h1 id="im-tired-out">I’m tired out.</h1>
<h1 id="im-dragging">I’m dragging.</h1>
<h1 id="im-stuffed">I’m stuffed.</h1>
<h1 id="im-drowsy">I’m drowsy.</h1>
<h1 id="i-can-hardly-keep-my-eyes-open">I can hardly keep my eyes open.</h1>
<h1 id="im-off-to-bed">I’m off to bed.</h1>
<h1 id="im-gonna-hit-the-sack">I’m gonna hit the sack.</h1>
<h1 id="im-all-in">I’m all in</h1>
<h1 id="im-shattered">I’m shattered</h1>
<h1 id="im-dead-to-the-world">I’m dead to the world</h1>
<h1 id="im-at-the-end-of-my-rope">I’m at the end of my rope</h1>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在英语中，also, as well, too, either 都有“也”的意思，但是在使用方法上却不尽相同。总的来说，前三个用于表达肯定意思中的“也”，最后一个表达的是否定意思中的“也”。下面，我们就来看看具体的不同之处。</p>
<h1 id="1also">1.	Also</h1>
<p>常用于写作中，少用于口语中<br>
位置：句首，句中&amp;句末</p>
<p>句首：强调后面的句子或是新加入的观点，后面应该加上逗号。</p>
<p><em>It’s very humid. Also, you can easily get sunburnt.<br>
那里（空气）很潮湿，同时，你也很容易晒伤。</em></p>
<p>句中：用作副词，在主语和主动词之间，或者在情态动词&amp;第一个助动词之后。作用是连接之后的从句。</p>
<p><em>She works very hard but she also goes to the gym every week.<br>
她工作很努力，但是她同时也每周都去一次健身房。</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve been working in the garden this week, and I’ve also been reading a lot.<br>
我这周一直在整修花园，我同时也在一直读书。</em></p>
<p>句尾：连接两个短句。在口语中我们常用as well &amp; too替代also。</p>
<p><em>She contacted him in the office but he didn’t answer the phone. His mobile phone was silent also. (or His mobile phone was silent too. or … was silent as well.)<br>
她在办公室里给他打电话，但是他没有接，他的手机是在静音的状态。（用too, as well, 也可以）</em></p>
<h1 id="2as-well">2.	As well</h1>
<p>常用于口语中，少用于写作中<br>
位置：常用于句尾,不要放在句首。</p>
<p><em>I just ignored it. I think everybody else did as well.<br>
<s>Not: As well I think everybody else did.</s></em></p>
<h1 id="3too">3.	Too</h1>
<p>位置：常用于句尾，也可在句中</p>
<p>句尾：<br>
<em>Gill’s having chicken. I’ll probably have chicken too.<br>
Gill 要吃鸡肉，我应该也吃鸡肉。</em></p>
<p><em>She looks really tired and she must be really hungry too.<br>
她看起来很累，她应该也很饿的吧。</em></p>
<p>句中：直接跟在主语之后，如果直接修饰主语的话。不跟在情态动词和助动词之后。</p>
<p><em>I too thought she looked unwell.<br>
我也认为她看起来气色不是很好。</em></p>
<p><em>We, too, have been very pleased to receive the prize on her behalf.<br>
我们也很开心可以代表她领奖。<br>
<s>Not: We have too been very pleased …</s><br>
不是这样的表述方式。</em></p>
<h1 id="4either">4.	Either</h1>
<p>用法一：否定含义的“也”</p>
<p><em>Bill’s not here. I don’t think Dave is either, is he?<br>
bill不在这里，我感觉Dave应该也不在的吧，对不对？<br>
<s>Not: I don’t think Dave is also/as well/too.</s><br>
不是这样的表述方式。</em></p>
<p><em>She doesn’t like eggs and she doesn’t like fish either.<br>
她不喜欢鸡蛋，她也不喜欢鱼。</em></p>
<p><em>It was a really nice hotel, and it wasn’t very expensive either.<br>
这个酒店很好，而且价格也不贵。</em></p>
<p>用法二：either .. or … 提供不同选项或者替代方案</p>

<h1 id="问题答案">问题&amp;答案</h1>
<h2 id="part-1-2">Part 1</h2>
<p>Examiner: Hello, my name is ---. This is the IELTS speaking test. Can you tell me your full name, please?<br>
Student: My name’s ---.</p>
<p>Examiner: And can you tell me where you’re from?<br>
Student: I’m from a small town near Northampton, in the UK.</p>
<p>Examiner: Can I see your identification, please?<br>
Student: Yes, of course. Here you are.</p>
<p>Examiner: Okay, thank you very much. Now, in this first part I’d like to know something about you. First of all, can you tell me about the kind of music you like?<br>
Student: Sure, well, I’m a big fan of what you might call alternative electronica. It’s hard to classify, because when you say ‘electronica’, people think of dance music, but I wouldn’t call it that. Basically, I listen to a lot of stuff with hip-hop, funk or disco influences, but most of my friends think my taste in music is a bit weird.</p>
<p>Examiner: I see. And, where do you like to listen to music?<br>
Student: I listen to music pretty much any time that I’m at home. So, if I’m doing housework, or cooking, or anything like that, I’ll put some music on. Sometimes I also listen to music on the bus. Especially if I’m going to play sport or to the gym, I’ll listen to some high-energy tunes on the way to get myself pumped up.</p>
<p>Examiner: Yeah, okay. Why do you think music is so important in many people’s lives?<br>
Student: Hmm… That’s a big question… [pause] Well, first of all music has always been part of human culture, so in that sense obviously it’s an important part of our lives. I guess that’s because music can have such a powerful effect on our emotions. Music can lift you up, or inspire you, or make you feel sad. I’d certainly find it hard to live without it!</p>
<p>Examiner: Uh-huh. I’d like to move on and talk about transport. What’s the best way to get around your city?<br>
Student: I live in quite a small town, so it’s very easy to get around. You can walk or cycle to a lot of places, although some roads are a bit dangerous for bikes. There are buses which are fairly reliable, but they’re not the fastest way to get around. Finally, you can take a taxi or an Uber if you want to get somewhere fast and you don’t mind paying a bit extra.</p>
<p>Examiner: Alright. And, have you ever learned to drive?<br>
Student: Yes, I learned in the UK as soon as I was old enough, although I have to say I haven’t driven for several years! I’m not sure if you’d want to get in a car with me, but I guess I’d pick it up again quite quickly. There’s just not much point in having a car where I am now, because I can walk or ride my bike around town, and take public transport if I want to go somewhere else, for the weekend or whatever.</p>
<p>Examiner: I see. Do you think everybody should learn to drive?<br>
Student: Er… That’s a strange idea. I think it’s up to each person to decide. It can be very useful in some places. For example, where I grew up in the UK… It’s a rural area, and if you don’t have a car you’re pretty isolated. If you live somewhere like that, you should probably learn to drive. But, it’s still a choice, right?</p>
<h2 id="part-2-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>Examiner: Now, I’m going to give you a topic and I’d like you to talk about it for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.</p>
<p>Describe something difficult you learned to do.<br>
You should say:<br>
– what you learned to do<br>
– how you learned to do it<br>
– why it was difficult<br>
and explain whether you’re glad that you learned to do this or not.</p>
<p>Examiner: Are you ready?<br>
Student: Yes.<br>
Examiner: Okay, please tell me about something difficult you learned to do.</p>
<p>Student: So, I’m going to tell you about learning to drive a car with manual transmission. I’m from the States, and almost no one drives a manual there; most cars are automatic. When I came to Europe, I found it was totally the opposite here; driving a manual is the norm, and automatics are rare. I guess here they’re associated with very expensive, luxury cars. Anyway, I had to learn to drive stick, and it was so difficult! It was doubly hard because I already knew how to drive, so it felt extra frustrating to be behind the wheel but unable to do the things I would normally do. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea but I didn’t get any help; I could have gone to a driving school but I didn’t. I just practiced and tried to learn by myself, by driving around car parks and open spaces and things like that. That was okay, but when I went out and drove properly, on the streets with traffic, it was super stressful. I just couldn’t get the clutch right, and then I’d stall and I’d be stressing out while everyone was honking at me. I can’t say that I’m glad that I learned it. I mean, I just learned to do it because I had to, and I didn’t enjoy the experience! If it were up to me, I’d rather just have an automatic car.</p>
<p>Examiner: Thank you. So, what do you use your car for?<br>
Student: Mostly for getting to work. I live quite far from the nearest metro station and the bus lines aren’t good, so it’s much easier to drive. Sometimes we go out of town for the weekends, too.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-2">Part 3</h2>
<p>Examiner: Right, I’d like to ask some questions related to this topic. First, let’s talk about learning new things. What motivates people to learn new things?<br>
Student: Wow… that’s a big question! Well, there are lots of reasons. The main one I guess is just necessity. For example, if you want to work in a particular field, you’ll need some specific training, skills, qualifications… Then, when you start a new job, you generally have to adapt and learn a lot of new things, even if you came in with a lot of theoretical knowledge. What else? I think also interest is important… I mean, people learn to do new things because they’re interested in them or they find something enjoyable. For example, no one needs to learn to play a musical instrument, but a lot of people do so because it brings them pleasure.</p>
<p>Examiner: Do you think the way that people learn new things has changed compared to the past?<br>
Student: Absolutely. Of course, the Internet and the development of smartphones and other new technologies have had a huge influence. We all have easy access to so much information now, which wasn’t the case in the past at all. Before, people would need to dedicate a lot of time and effort to finding an expert, or doing research in order to learn about something new. Now, you can find tutorials online, ask people for help in discussion forums, and things like that. So, it’s a big difference, but I think it’s mostly for the better.</p>
<p>Examiner: How do you think technology will change the way people learn new things in the future?<br>
Student: Hmm… I’m not sure. I think we’ll see the same trends developing… What I mean is: the big changes have already happened, but I don’t think they’ve run their course yet. So, a lot of people still have the idea that you learn something by going to a class, reading books, etc., and they haven’t realised that you just have more options nowadays. To tie all this together, I think that in the future, education and learning will be more globalised and democratic, in that everybody will have similar opportunities to learn. I suppose that might mean that formal education diminishes in significance, but I’m not sure that will actually happen.</p>
<p>Examiner: Okay, let’s move on to talk about school and education. How can parents or students choose the best school or university?<br>
Student: In my experience, the only way to know what a school or university is really like is to talk to people who already study there and see what they say. Of course, you can go and look around, but I don’t think you can learn very much just by walking around a school. If you talk to some of the staff and students, you can get a feel of what kind of establishment it is, and whether it’s a good fit for you, or your child, whoever you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Examiner: Mm-hmm. How do people in your country feel about private education?<br>
Student: Huh… I really don’t know. I went to a public school, and so did everyone I know. It’s not really a topic which comes up that much, you know? Personally, I don’t have strong opinions; if someone wants to pay to send their child to a private school, then why not? Given that there aren’t that many private schools, it’s just not something that people are so aware of.</p>
<p>Examiner: I see. Do you think that university education should be free?<br>
Student: Definitely, yes. In the USA, university is insanely expensive; parents have to start saving up from the moment their child is born. I think this leads to elitist outcomes… I mean that the richest kids go to the best universities, and if you don’t have a lot of money behind you, your options are more limited. That said, I realize that graduates tend to earn more, so it might be fairer to have some kind of graduate tax, so that the people who erm… benefit from higher education also help to fund it. That seems to me to be the fairest solution.<br>
Examiner: Thank you. That’s the end of the speaking test.</p>
<p>好的，看完了吗？自己感觉怎么样呢？要注意积累好的用法额！～<br>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>雅思口语part2通常是由一个话题加四个小问题组成，在考试的时候需要烤鸭们自己讲差不多两分钟，这两分钟的内容输出，说多不多，说少不少，如何让考官可以对我们的内容有一个清晰的了解就需要我们将自己的答案给有组织的呈现出来，那么就会涉及到连接句的使用。</p>
<p>建议烤鸭们不要将心思过度放在这些连接句上，然后背很多非常长，一看就很像是套路句的连接句，比如说：<br>
off the top of my head, the person i ....<br>
when i see this topic, the person....<br>
.....</p>
<p>使用连接句的主要目的是让我们的答案更清晰，方便考官知道我们到底在讲什么，而不是拿那些无比长的套句来冲量，所以我们的主要努力还是要放在内容上，那么在连接句的使用上建议简短，直接即可。</p>
<p>不管我们的答案到底是5段还是4段，都可以借鉴以下的这些句子。</p>

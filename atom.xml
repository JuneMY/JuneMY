        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>必须要承认，我一直都不是书虫类型的人，以前看书大部分是为了考试，其余的，顶多也就是看一些畅销书，消磨时光罢了。未曾想，随着年龄越来越大，竟然慢慢可以从看书中找寻到一直渴望的内心的平静。陆陆续续的，也看了一些书，看的时候，思绪万千，想到了很多，可是人又是那么的健忘，看完之后，很快便忘了七七八八。所以，在2020年的伊始，立一个flag，每个月至少写一篇书评吧（以后打脸了再说），就算是记录一下自己的成长。希望一年，或者两年后回看，能够感受到自己的时光没有白白流逝，而是转化为文字，记录了下来，即使一开始如同中学生作文那般稚嫩。</p>
<p>其实这本书我在2019年12月就已经看完了，但是迟迟不敢下笔写书评，或许是恐惧吧，毕竟已经那么长时间不曾正儿八经地输出自己的想法，怕没什么可写的，也怕写的乱七八糟，不像样子。就是鸵鸟一样，藏着，假装这样别人就不知道我的浅薄了。后来发现自己想的太多了，互联网上的内容那么多，又有多少人会注意到我；人们都是那么得忙，谁会管我的文字是否成熟。这样安慰过自己以后，就释然了，不再战战兢兢的，决定提笔写写自己的想法。</p>
<p>一开始看这本书纯属偶然，不过是一本学习英语的app送的，拿到手以后看着封面挺有趣的，就打开了。看之前完全不知道到底是什么类型的，梗概是什么，后来发现，这样也好，刚好可以检验一下是否这本书对我的胃口。实践出真知，我并不喜欢，尽管这本书在2014年荣获亚马逊Best Book的第一。</p>
<p>这本书以一个小姑娘莉迪亚的死展开，然后抽丝剥茧式的，分析一个普通却又不普通的美国家庭中存在的问题， 聊到了，教育，婚姻，种族。说它普通，是因为其实并没有什么轰轰烈烈又转折的情节，除了一开始的“案件”给了一些悬疑的背景，可是后来发现这个“案件”竟是意外而已；说它不普通，因为故事的背景设置在上世纪七十年代，美国中部俄亥俄州的一个小镇，而且这个家庭是种族通婚。莉迪亚的母亲是一个漂亮又平凡的美国白人，父亲詹姆斯是中国的二代移民。 放在现代可能不怎么会吸引人的目光了，但是美国的最高法院于1967年才通过了反异族通婚法，在此之前，不同种族之间结婚是违反法律的行为，因此，这个跨种族的结合才显得那么的不同。</p>
<p>这本书涉及到的可聊的内容还是蛮多的，但是其中最触动我的是两个，一个是詹姆斯那么执着的想要的“融入”，另一个是玛丽琳对女儿的“爱”。他们两个把自己的期许，不加掩饰地压在了莉迪亚的身上，当然也采用了父母最常用的说法—为了你好，如此沉甸甸，像两个又浓又密的翅膀，莉迪亚被包裹在里面，挣扎不得，直到最后窒息在其中。私以为这种爱最为无耻且自私，将下一代作为自己希望的延续却不曾想过自己的下一代首先是要有完整的独立人格存在于世，自己的爱好，自己的想法，自己的未来。继而联想到曾经看到过的一段话，若是父母在生我之前可以问我一下，我坚决选择不要来到这个世上。这句话，引起了我强烈的共鸣，尤其是最近这几个月，我越来越绝望，对这个社会，找不到自己存在的意义。</p>
<p>所谓融入<em>so-called blend in</em><br>
在本书中，詹姆斯一直想要可以真正地融入到美国主流环境，其源头来自于他的童年经历，虽出生且生长在美国，但是却从未被当成过是“美国人”，主要还是因为他的肤色，总是可以让他显得那么的与众不同，当然不是正面的不同。在上学的时候，他是学校里唯一的一个亚裔，他所有的一切都会引起其他人的好奇。他在研究着学业而他的同学们在研究着他，他的瞳孔的颜色。或许他的同学真的只是好奇而已，但是却给年幼的他带来了心理上的阴影。若是他可以明白，那真的不是他的肤色带来的问题，多好。因为，很有可能，其他的小伙伴们研究他是像研究没有见过的物品一样，记得在我小时候，我那四十八线的小村庄来了一个外国人采风，结果差不多半个村子的人都快要围上去了，都想看看那个金发碧眼的外国人。我不感觉当时围上去的人全都是有恶意的，估计他们也不知道自己的举动会不会影响到别人。</p>
<p>詹姆斯在哈佛教学的时候，他所教的科目是<em>The cowboy in American culture</em>.第一节课上，在看到授课老师竟然是一个其貌不扬且瘦弱的亚裔以后，大部分的学生立刻选择了换课，其中还有当着他的面走出教室的。我想，他们应该都会感觉这是一个笑话，一个亚裔，来教美国文化。最有趣的是，玛丽琳一开始震惊与詹姆斯的英语如此之好，竟然都没有口音。当然后来，她也是被这个东方男人的“不同”给吸引到的。这里，我不能说这些学生没有恶意，他们只是没有脑子罢了。可是这些事，脱去种族的外衣，依然存在，就像我来自一个村到不能再村的地方，很多人会以为我的英语会带着极强的地方特色，有的时候，也会想要看我的笑话。</p>
<p>詹姆斯极力摆脱着肤色的不同给他带来的心理上的烙印，甚至来说，他厌恶自己的肤色带来的一系列不同。在学校读书的时候，他拒绝父母接送他，这样同学们就不会看到他的父母。他不会读写中文，当然内心也十分抗拒去学。同时，他拒绝吃中餐，宁愿吃一直被中国留学生吐槽的难吃到极点的冷三明治。在学校里，他不选跟亚洲或者亚洲文化有关的课程，而选择基本跟东方毫无联系的的—<em>cowboy</em>。无非，就是想要别人认为他是一个“美国人”罢了。作为社会中的一员，想要“融入，”基本上可以算是一种本能反应了。我们到了一个新的环境，总是会不自觉的想要去找跟我们有相同或者类似经历的小伙伴，性别，家乡，爱好，等等。好像这样，我们就不会感到孤单。这样的融入，会给我们带来什么什么好处呢？内心上的安全感？朋友？资源？关系网？</p>
<p>而一个人到底能不能融入，感受会受到内外和外在的双重影响，有些人自己本身就不爱跟别人交流，或者性格上的孤僻不是大众喜爱的那个类型，有的或许是周围环境的问题，并不一定是自己不愿踏出那一步。可是，我想问的是，扪心自问一下，难道我们自己就很“融入”自己目前所在的环境中吗？即使没有受到文化，种族这些问题的影响。摸摸我的良心，我感觉不是的，从小时候到现在，一直都不是什么受欢迎那种类型的人，没有什么朋友，一直都感觉自己像是游走在群体的边缘，我不理解他们，他们也不理解我。所以，我个人感觉，即使在相同的肤色，文化中，依然会存在无法融入的问题。在本书中，玛丽琳就是很好的例子，即使身为美国白人，她依然面临着同样的问题，没有什么朋友，无法做到所谓的融入。当然她没有经历过别人研究她的瞳孔颜色这么荒谬的事儿，但是不代表她没有经历过别的研究。</p>
<p>那么如果不能融入，又该如何呢？感觉这个，会像是一个自我救赎的过程。诚然，人乃群居性动物，但是我认为也要认识到，有的时候，不能融入，没有关系，重要的是要明白其实就算是所谓那个“圈子”里的人，也不见得快乐，不见得能够解决掉所有的问题，重要的还是自己的内心强大。就像为什么被研究的詹姆斯会非常敏感，而我的小镇上出现过的那个外国人应该不会有呢？的确，我没有问过那个外国人本人，但是有问过有相同经历的外国人。他们给我的回复是，感觉哪些村民们很有趣—没有见过世面的有趣。那么反过来想，当时研究詹姆斯的人，不也是这样的吗？</p>
<p>亲密暴力<em>IPV-intimate partner violence</em><br>
这个词是我在看完书以后才接触到的，它的意思是现任或前任配偶或伴侣针对另一位配偶或伴侣的亲密关系中的家庭暴力。其形式有多种，身体，言语，精神，经济和性虐待。如果单单根据定义，感觉把玛丽琳的“爱”定义为亲密暴力似乎不妥，但是再仔细琢磨一下，感觉也算属于其中。玛丽琳利用了女儿对她的爱从而达到了操控女儿的目的。</p>
<p>所有的一开始起源于玛丽琳想要回到自己曾经为自己定下的那个人生轨迹中去，上医学院，然后成为一名医生。然而她的行程断在了遇到了詹姆斯，怀孕，辍学。在母亲去世时，她去整理遗物，不经意间翻到了母亲的那本食谱，翻着翻着，突然感觉母亲的一生，留下的印迹似乎不过是如何做好饭，这个想法使她震惊，因为现在的她，正在同样的道路上。然后她像被闪电劈了一样，不断地告诉自己，“<em>I will never end up like that</em>”。然后，在辍学多年后，她决定重新开始自己中断的学业。</p>
<p>我非常欣赏她的勇气和想法，但是确实完全无法理解她的做法。因为她几乎是完全抛弃了剩下的父子三人，独自离开了家。可能在我幼稚的想法里，她可以先考虑跟詹姆斯聊聊，虽然很有可能詹姆斯不支持，不理解，但是至少可以让他知道你的想法。或者实在是理念上不同了，离婚再开始。完全没有必要让他们有那种悬着的感觉。当然最后玛丽琳还是没有回到她想要的轨迹上，因为她又怀孕了。而她这次非常自私且不负责任的做法给自己的孩子们，尤其是莉迪亚造成了极大的恐惧。莉迪亚太害怕回再次失去母亲了，于是从这次事件以后，便对母亲说的所有都说yes.而玛丽琳，彻彻底底得利用了女儿对她的爱，利用了女儿不过是想要一个母亲的渴望。</p>
<p>可是，如果玛丽琳一开始可以想通，自己的生活是自己的，但是女儿也有属于女儿自己的生活，而不是完全把自己的想法强加到莉迪亚身上，是不是就不会有后面悲剧的发生。她是如此的自私，利用，裹挟着女儿的懂事，肆意挥霍着女儿对她的爱，直到最后女儿再也无法承受这份爱。书的最后，她看到了女儿偷偷留下了她以为自己已经扔掉的那本食谱，发现了女儿全部是因为爱她才答应了她所有的要求。在那个时候，我这个旁观者，多么的希望这个懂事的孩子可以像其她的青春期的女孩子那样，叛逆一下，不要那么听父母的话，多好。</p>
<p>看书的时候，想起了有一段时间，网上炒的沸沸扬扬的关于papi酱人生重要人物顺序的那个问题，我个人完全同意papi的想法，一个人连自我的都没有的时候，谈何爱其他人，即使爱，说不定也是带着私欲的爱。如果没有了自我，全部都是为了别人，那么你存在的意义，到底是什么？？多么希望父母可以不要把自己的孩子作为自己的私有财产，不要那么的随意控制，胁迫他们选择自己的人生道路。而孩子们，争点气，不要被别人胁迫，好吗？</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>I'm tired.</strong><br>
不管是在原因中还是最新的一个话题中，都有对累的描述，我们需要积累不同的表达方式，这样才可以避免重复。<br>
当然，还需要注意好用法额～</p>
<p><strong>加副词来表示程度</strong><br>
<em>I'm very tired.</em><br>
<em>I'm kind of tired.</em><br>
<em>He is pretty tired.</em><br>
<em>I am unbelievably tired.</em><br>
<em>She is mentally tired.</em><br>
<em>We are physically tired.</em><br>
<em><strong>I'm dead tired.</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>I’m dog-tired.</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>I’m tired to the bone.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="im-exhausted">I'm exhausted.</h1>
<p>The word &quot;exhausted&quot; means very tired.<br>
I am exhausted.<br>
<em>She felt exhausted after the game.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-beat">I'm beat.</h1>
<p>This is a common expression to say that we are tired. We only use this in casual situations.</p>
<h1 id="i-am-drained">I am drained.</h1>
<p>drain本身是排水的意思<br>
在这里的用法很形象，你被抽干了，那自然就很累了<br>
<em>We have been working so much. I am drained.</em><br>
<em>I feel drained after working all weekend.</em></p>
<p>draining  adj.<br>
同样的意思，但是主语不一样<br>
在这里主语应该是物<br>
causing you to lose most of your energy; very tiring<br>
<em>He found the funeral service emotionally draining.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-wiped-out">I'm wiped out.</h1>
<p>similar to &quot;I'm drained&quot;</p>
<h1 id="im-worn-out">I'm worn out.</h1>
<p>需要注意的是，这个短语用来表示在工作了很久以后很累<br>
<em>I have worked every day for the last 3 months. I'm worn out.</em><br>
<em>We have been so busy this week. I am worn out.</em><br>
<em>We also use the phrase &quot;worn out&quot; with clothes or things that we have used for a long long time and now their condition is not good.</em><br>
<em>I have been wearing these shoes for 2 years. They are worn out.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-burnt-out">I'm burnt out.</h1>
<p>This expression is only used to show that we are tired because of doing something over a long period of time. All of our energy has been used up. This expression has the feeling that we have lost our passion or desire to do something.<br>
<em>I have worked overtime every day for the past month. I am burnt out.</em><br>
<em>I think I need a vacation. I feel burnt out.</em><br>
<em>Remember that we cannot use this with short-term things.</em><br>
<em>I ran for an hour today. I am burnt out.</em><br>
<em>I ran for an hour today. I am exhausted.</em></p>
<h1 id="im-fried">I'm fried.</h1>
<p>It means that I am so tired, that my brain is fried. So, we are so tired that we cannot think well.</p>
<h1 id="im-spent">I'm spent.</h1>
<p>This means that we have spent all of our energy. Therefore, we feel tired.</p>
<h1 id="i-am-weary">I am weary.</h1>
<p>&quot;Weary&quot; is a more formal word that means tired. We are more likely to see this in books and writing.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在英语中，also, as well, too, either 都有“也”的意思，但是在使用方法上却不尽相同。总的来说，前三个用于表达肯定意思中的“也”，最后一个表达的是否定意思中的“也”。下面，我们就来看看具体的不同之处。</p>
<h1 id="1also">1.	Also</h1>
<p>常用于写作中，少用于口语中<br>
位置：句首，句中&amp;句末</p>
<p>句首：强调后面的句子或是新加入的观点，后面应该加上逗号。</p>
<p><em>It’s very humid. Also, you can easily get sunburnt.<br>
那里（空气）很潮湿，同时，你也很容易晒伤。</em></p>
<p>句中：用作副词，在主语和主动词之间，或者在情态动词&amp;第一个助动词之后。作用是连接之后的从句。</p>
<p><em>She works very hard but she also goes to the gym every week.<br>
她工作很努力，但是她同时也每周都去一次健身房。</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve been working in the garden this week, and I’ve also been reading a lot.<br>
我这周一直在整修花园，我同时也在一直读书。</em></p>
<p>句尾：连接两个短句。在口语中我们常用as well &amp; too替代also。</p>
<p><em>She contacted him in the office but he didn’t answer the phone. His mobile phone was silent also. (or His mobile phone was silent too. or … was silent as well.)<br>
她在办公室里给他打电话，但是他没有接，他的手机是在静音的状态。（用too, as well, 也可以）</em></p>
<h1 id="2as-well">2.	As well</h1>
<p>常用于口语中，少用于写作中<br>
位置：常用于句尾,不要放在句首。</p>

<s>Not: As well I think everybody else did.</s></em></p>
<h1 id="3too">3.	Too</h1>

Gill 要吃鸡肉，我应该也吃鸡肉。</em></p>
<p><em>She looks really tired and she must be really hungry too.<br>
她看起来很累，她应该也很饿的吧。</em></p>
<p>句中：直接跟在主语之后，如果直接修饰主语的话。不跟在情态动词和助动词之后。</p>
<p><em>I too thought she looked unwell.<br>
我也认为她看起来气色不是很好。</em></p>
<p><em>We, too, have been very pleased to receive the prize on her behalf.<br>
我们也很开心可以代表她领奖。<br>
<s>Not: We have too been very pleased …</s><br>
不是这样的表述方式。</em></p>
<h1 id="4either">4.	Either</h1>
<p>用法一：否定含义的“也”</p>
<p><em>Bill’s not here. I don’t think Dave is either, is he?<br>
bill不在这里，我感觉Dave应该也不在的吧，对不对？<br>
<s>Not: I don’t think Dave is also/as well/too.</s><br>
不是这样的表述方式。</em></p>
<p><em>She doesn’t like eggs and she doesn’t like fish either.<br>
她不喜欢鸡蛋，她也不喜欢鱼。</em></p>
<p><em>It was a really nice hotel, and it wasn’t very expensive either.<br>

<h1 id="问题答案">问题&amp;答案</h1>
<h2 id="part-1-2">Part 1</h2>
<p>Examiner: Hello, my name is ---. This is the IELTS speaking test. Can you tell me your full name, please?<br>
Student: My name’s ---.</p>
<p>Examiner: And can you tell me where you’re from?<br>
Student: I’m from a small town near Northampton, in the UK.</p>
<p>Examiner: Can I see your identification, please?<br>
Student: Yes, of course. Here you are.</p>
<p>Examiner: Okay, thank you very much. Now, in this first part I’d like to know something about you. First of all, can you tell me about the kind of music you like?<br>
Student: Sure, well, I’m a big fan of what you might call alternative electronica. It’s hard to classify, because when you say ‘electronica’, people think of dance music, but I wouldn’t call it that. Basically, I listen to a lot of stuff with hip-hop, funk or disco influences, but most of my friends think my taste in music is a bit weird.</p>
<p>Examiner: I see. And, where do you like to listen to music?<br>
Student: I listen to music pretty much any time that I’m at home. So, if I’m doing housework, or cooking, or anything like that, I’ll put some music on. Sometimes I also listen to music on the bus. Especially if I’m going to play sport or to the gym, I’ll listen to some high-energy tunes on the way to get myself pumped up.</p>
<p>Examiner: Yeah, okay. Why do you think music is so important in many people’s lives?<br>
Student: Hmm… That’s a big question… [pause] Well, first of all music has always been part of human culture, so in that sense obviously it’s an important part of our lives. I guess that’s because music can have such a powerful effect on our emotions. Music can lift you up, or inspire you, or make you feel sad. I’d certainly find it hard to live without it!</p>
<p>Examiner: Uh-huh. I’d like to move on and talk about transport. What’s the best way to get around your city?<br>
Student: I live in quite a small town, so it’s very easy to get around. You can walk or cycle to a lot of places, although some roads are a bit dangerous for bikes. There are buses which are fairly reliable, but they’re not the fastest way to get around. Finally, you can take a taxi or an Uber if you want to get somewhere fast and you don’t mind paying a bit extra.</p>
<p>Examiner: Alright. And, have you ever learned to drive?<br>
Student: Yes, I learned in the UK as soon as I was old enough, although I have to say I haven’t driven for several years! I’m not sure if you’d want to get in a car with me, but I guess I’d pick it up again quite quickly. There’s just not much point in having a car where I am now, because I can walk or ride my bike around town, and take public transport if I want to go somewhere else, for the weekend or whatever.</p>
<p>Examiner: I see. Do you think everybody should learn to drive?<br>
Student: Er… That’s a strange idea. I think it’s up to each person to decide. It can be very useful in some places. For example, where I grew up in the UK… It’s a rural area, and if you don’t have a car you’re pretty isolated. If you live somewhere like that, you should probably learn to drive. But, it’s still a choice, right?</p>
<h2 id="part-2-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>Examiner: Now, I’m going to give you a topic and I’d like you to talk about it for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.</p>
<p>Describe something difficult you learned to do.<br>
You should say:<br>
– what you learned to do<br>
– how you learned to do it<br>
– why it was difficult<br>
and explain whether you’re glad that you learned to do this or not.</p>
<p>Examiner: Are you ready?<br>
Student: Yes.<br>
Examiner: Okay, please tell me about something difficult you learned to do.</p>
<p>Student: So, I’m going to tell you about learning to drive a car with manual transmission. I’m from the States, and almost no one drives a manual there; most cars are automatic. When I came to Europe, I found it was totally the opposite here; driving a manual is the norm, and automatics are rare. I guess here they’re associated with very expensive, luxury cars. Anyway, I had to learn to drive stick, and it was so difficult! It was doubly hard because I already knew how to drive, so it felt extra frustrating to be behind the wheel but unable to do the things I would normally do. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea but I didn’t get any help; I could have gone to a driving school but I didn’t. I just practiced and tried to learn by myself, by driving around car parks and open spaces and things like that. That was okay, but when I went out and drove properly, on the streets with traffic, it was super stressful. I just couldn’t get the clutch right, and then I’d stall and I’d be stressing out while everyone was honking at me. I can’t say that I’m glad that I learned it. I mean, I just learned to do it because I had to, and I didn’t enjoy the experience! If it were up to me, I’d rather just have an automatic car.</p>
<p>Examiner: Thank you. So, what do you use your car for?<br>
Student: Mostly for getting to work. I live quite far from the nearest metro station and the bus lines aren’t good, so it’s much easier to drive. Sometimes we go out of town for the weekends, too.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-2">Part 3</h2>
<p>Examiner: Right, I’d like to ask some questions related to this topic. First, let’s talk about learning new things. What motivates people to learn new things?<br>
Student: Wow… that’s a big question! Well, there are lots of reasons. The main one I guess is just necessity. For example, if you want to work in a particular field, you’ll need some specific training, skills, qualifications… Then, when you start a new job, you generally have to adapt and learn a lot of new things, even if you came in with a lot of theoretical knowledge. What else? I think also interest is important… I mean, people learn to do new things because they’re interested in them or they find something enjoyable. For example, no one needs to learn to play a musical instrument, but a lot of people do so because it brings them pleasure.</p>
<p>Examiner: Do you think the way that people learn new things has changed compared to the past?<br>
Student: Absolutely. Of course, the Internet and the development of smartphones and other new technologies have had a huge influence. We all have easy access to so much information now, which wasn’t the case in the past at all. Before, people would need to dedicate a lot of time and effort to finding an expert, or doing research in order to learn about something new. Now, you can find tutorials online, ask people for help in discussion forums, and things like that. So, it’s a big difference, but I think it’s mostly for the better.</p>
<p>Examiner: How do you think technology will change the way people learn new things in the future?<br>
Student: Hmm… I’m not sure. I think we’ll see the same trends developing… What I mean is: the big changes have already happened, but I don’t think they’ve run their course yet. So, a lot of people still have the idea that you learn something by going to a class, reading books, etc., and they haven’t realised that you just have more options nowadays. To tie all this together, I think that in the future, education and learning will be more globalised and democratic, in that everybody will have similar opportunities to learn. I suppose that might mean that formal education diminishes in significance, but I’m not sure that will actually happen.</p>
<p>Examiner: Okay, let’s move on to talk about school and education. How can parents or students choose the best school or university?<br>
Student: In my experience, the only way to know what a school or university is really like is to talk to people who already study there and see what they say. Of course, you can go and look around, but I don’t think you can learn very much just by walking around a school. If you talk to some of the staff and students, you can get a feel of what kind of establishment it is, and whether it’s a good fit for you, or your child, whoever you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Examiner: Mm-hmm. How do people in your country feel about private education?<br>
Student: Huh… I really don’t know. I went to a public school, and so did everyone I know. It’s not really a topic which comes up that much, you know? Personally, I don’t have strong opinions; if someone wants to pay to send their child to a private school, then why not? Given that there aren’t that many private schools, it’s just not something that people are so aware of.</p>
<p>Examiner: I see. Do you think that university education should be free?<br>
Student: Definitely, yes. In the USA, university is insanely expensive; parents have to start saving up from the moment their child is born. I think this leads to elitist outcomes… I mean that the richest kids go to the best universities, and if you don’t have a lot of money behind you, your options are more limited. That said, I realize that graduates tend to earn more, so it might be fairer to have some kind of graduate tax, so that the people who erm… benefit from higher education also help to fund it. That seems to me to be the fairest solution.<br>
Examiner: Thank you. That’s the end of the speaking test.</p>
